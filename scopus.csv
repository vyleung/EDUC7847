Building on insights from research in cognitive psychology, organizational leadership, and education, we define a mindset as a combination of cognitive filters and processes through which professionals interpret their professional environments and execute their professional responsibilities. We review the professional and academic literature and identify five key mindsets relevant for accounting graduates. Given the overarching obligation of accountants to protect the public trust, we treat the ‘‘public interest mindset’’ (focus on ‘‘we’’ versus ‘‘I,’’ integrity, and professionalism) as foundational in the accounting profession. The four other key mindsets include (1) growth, (2) professional skepticism, (3) analytical/digital, and (4) global. We provide definitions of these mindsets, discuss their relevance for accounting, and suggest potential pedagogical approaches for their integration into 21st century accounting education. © 2021, American Accounting Association.

Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering. © 2021 American Society for Engineering Education.","analytics; diversity; engineering major choice; engineering pathways; high school; quantitative","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107973553"

MOOCs are quite different from classical distance learning settings in terms of their open-access features, such as open licensing of course content, and their use of specific infrastructures for communications and learning tools. Studies over the past 2 years (2018, 2019) have examined the multitude of experimental business models for MOOCs. However, MOOCs have also experimented with a wide variety of course content, teaching and learning methods, and assessment strategies. Very few articles have systematically examined these significant changes. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive, qualitative meta-analyses of over 200 peer-reviewed articles describing research on MOOCs. This analysis is organized around the following questions: (a) How can we classify existing MOOCs in terms of their support for learners and learning? (b) Which learners are benefiting from MOOCs, and to what degree have MOOCs explored approaches to student-centered learning? (c) To what degree are MOOCs meeting the needs of different learner audiences? (d) How can MOOC providers and participants communicate effectively to support student learning and engagement? (e) How can student activities be monitored to ensure that assessments of learning are performed effectively? The results of these analyses provide a reflection on the last decade of MOOC research and discussing the main achievements and the major research directions pursued in those years and points toward areas in need of additional research and development. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","learning aِِnalytics; massive open online courses; MOOCs; network learning; open assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091726702"

This study tested such an intervention using learning analytics and early performance feedback in large introductory courses, with comparison between course sections not exposed to the intervention. Distinct from other research, the present study replicated the efficacy of the intervention across 2 years, in multiple course subjects, and with different instructors at a 4-year Hispanic-serving institution. Importantly, findings also showed that high-risk college students especially benefitted from the intervention in terms of both achievement and persistence. Based on these findings, recommendations are made to higher education administrators about the potential gains to students when they are provided with early, consistent, and individualized feedback in all courses, made feasible by current technology. © The Author(s) 2018.","at-risk college students; college persistence; college student achievement; college student success; intervention study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052242802"

These programs are typically designed to be practitioner focused and many of them offer a Capstone course that gives students the opportunity to conduct a real-world analytics project. In this article, we describe the innovative design of a Capstone course offered to cohorts of approximately 110 graduate students in the business school at the University of Texas, Austin. This course is designed to deliver self-directed and experiential learning from interacting with business stakeholders and successfully completing team-based, business analytics projects within a commercial firm using the firm's data. The course design includes student and sponsor engagement, the formation of diverse balanced project teams, matching of teams with projects, and scaffolding, which includes consistent structured mentoring, team reflections, interim deliverables and in-class learning for practical skills not covered elsewhere in the curriculum. This course has now been offered successfully to two cohorts. In this article, we will also describe changes made for the second cohort related to team formation, project matching, mentoring and in-class learning. These changes were based on feedback from the first cohort. © 2022 Decision Sciences Institute.","artificial intelligence/machine learning; business analytics; capstone; course design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134006063"

Additionally, most of the educational software programs are no longer operated by the learning institutions but are run by third-party agencies. This means that in the decade since 2020, information about students is stored and handled outside premises and control of learning institutions. The personal information about students and their activity while they interact with learning management systems and online learning tools is increasingly in custody of cloud computing platforms, software-as-a-service providers, and learning tool vendors. There is an increasing will to use all the data and metadata from the activity of the students for research, to develop education management strategies, pedagogy approaches, and develop behavior control tools or learning tools informed by behavior analysis from learning analytics. Many times, these studies lack the ethical and moral perspective. In addition, there is an increasing number of cases in which this information has leaked or has been used in a shady way. Additionally, this information will be around for a long time, tied to the future digital profiles of the students whose data has been leaked. This paper hypothesizes that there has been an ongoing process of technological evolution that leads to a loss of control over personal information, which makes it even more difficult to protect user confidentiality and ensuring privacy, that data surveillance has entered the world of education, and that the current legal frameworks are not enough to really protect the student’s personal information. The paper analyzes how this situation came to pass, and why this is wrong. We conclude with some proposals to address it from its different root dimensions: Technical, cultural, legal, and organizational. © 2021 by the authors.

We used a binary native language marker (non-native English user vs. native English user) to distinguish between two groups in this multiple case study, which is based on the knowledge gained from a previous study reporting students’ significantly different experiences based on the two language markers (Han & Lee, Computer & Education, 179, Article 104395, 2022). We utilized a multimodal computer-mediated communication approach as a research guiding tool for examining the data—chatbot logs and the students’ self-reported open-ended responses. We analyzed 42 students’ (non-native English users: n = 27 and native English users: n = 15) precise language uses and constructional practices during student–chatbot interactions to investigate the similarities and differences between the two cases. Most importantly, we focused on the experiences of non-native English users with newly adopted technology, such as chatbots, highlighting a lack of attention to the challenges this group faces despite comprising the majority of MOOC students. By comparing the interactions between the two groups, we identified various student attitudes towards the chatbot with accompanying descriptions, hypothesizing that non-native English users’ positioning effects might have contributed to their negative experiences with the chatbot. We also found that misinterpreted contextualized cues could influence non-native English users more adversely than native English users from an interactional sociolinguistics perspective. Thus, we provide chatbot response design strategies that could support non-native English users better, such as informing users of the chatbot’s capabilities and limitations as early as possible during interactions. We argue that concentrating on the experiences of non-native English users with chatbots promotes a more inclusive learning environment regarding new technologies employed in MOOCs. © 2022, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Chatbot; Learning analytics; Massive open online courses; Non-native English user; Positioning","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137501633"

Innovation in higher education is crucial for preparing students for the ever-changing challenges they will face in the workplace and in society. Montessori education offers a unique perspective for addressing many of the shortcomings identified in current approaches to undergraduate instruction. This study involved designing a course that incorporated well-established principles of Montessori education—which has demonstrated success in fostering deep learning, engagement, intrinsic motivation, and adaptability particularly among adolescents. The methodology leverages the naturalistic approach to gathering real world evidence using an inductive design based on data from instructor field notes, weekly student response submissions, and an end-of-semester student survey. In conclusion, results of the study suggest Montessori education, particularly experiential learning elements and direct connections to industry, should continue to be explored for its potential to inspire innovation in higher education. However, successfully changing the instructional paradigm requires efforts beyond a single course. Truly shaping undergraduate education for the 21st century involves broad and integrated change across departments and even universities to empower students to take control of their own learning, to be inspired and motivated by their own intrinsic values, and to expand their thinking beyond narrow expectations of textbook learning.

However, the definition of the wireframe needs to have anthropological meaning and is highly dependent on experts’ experience. Hence, it is usually not easy to obtain a well-defined wireframe for a new set of shapes in available databases. An automated wireframe generation method would help relieve the need for the manual anthropometric definition to overcome such difficulty. One way to find such an automated wireframe generation method is to apply segmentation to divide the models into small mesh patches. Nevertheless, different segmentation approaches could have various segmented patches, thus resulting in diversified wireframes. How do these different sets of wireframes affect learning performance? In this paper, we attempt to answer this research question by defining several critical quantitative estimators to evaluate different wireframes’ learning performance. To find how such estimators influence wireframe-assisted learning accuracy, we conduct experiments by comparing different segmentation methods on human body shapes. We summarized several meaningful design guidelines for developing an automatic wireframe-aware segmentation method for human body learning with such verification.

While Coursera, edX, Udacity, and FutureLearn received most of the attention and scrutiny, an entirely new ecosystem of local MOOC providers was growing in parallel. This ecosystem is harder to study than the major players: they are spread around the world, have less staff devoted to maintaining research data, and operate in multiple languages with university and corporate regional partners. To better understand how online learning opportunities are expanding through this regional MOOC ecosystem, we created a research partnership among 15 different MOOC providers from nine countries. We gathered data from over eight million learners in six thousand MOOCs, and we conducted a large-scale survey with more than 10 thousand participants. From our analysis, we argue that these regional providers may be better positioned to meet the goals of expanding access to higher education in their regions than the better-known global providers. To make this claim we highlight three trends: first, regional providers attract a larger local population with more inclusive demographic profiles; second, students predominantly choose their courses based on topical interest, and regional providers do a better job at catering to those needs; and third, many students feel more at ease learning from institutions they already know and have references from. Our work raises the importance of local education in the global MOOC ecosystem, while calling for additional research and conversations across the diversity of MOOC providers. © 2022 The Authors","Cultural factors; Distance learning; Educational data mining; Equity; Large scale analytics; Learning analytics; Massive open online courses","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122502949"

A quasi-experimental and mixed method approach was conducted. The main results showed significant differences between the first and second term evaluations in the two groups. One of the main findings of the study is that the predictions were not very accurate for each student in the first term evaluation. However, the predictions became more accurate as the algorithm was fed with larger datasets from the second term evaluation. This result indicates how predictive algorithms based on decision trees, can offer a close approximation to the academic performance that will occur in the class, and this information could be use along with the personal impressions coming from the teacher. © 2022, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Commercially produced videos are commonly used by medical students but are rarely integrated into curricula. Objective: Our goal was to examine student engagement with medical education videos incorporated into a preclinical Cardiovascular Systems course. Methods: Students who took the first-year 8-week Cardiovascular Systems course in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study. Videos from Osmosis were recommended to be watched before live sessions throughout the course. Video use was monitored through dashboards, and course credit was given for watching videos. All students were emailed electronic surveys after the final exam asking about the course's blended learning experience and use of videos. Osmosis usage data for number of video views, multiple choice questions, and flashcards were extracted from Osmosis dashboards. Results: Overall, 232/359 (64.6%) students completed surveys, with rates by class of 81/154 (52.6%) for MD Class of 2022, 39/50 (78%) for MD/MPH Class of 2022, and 112/155 (72.3%) for MD Class of 2023. Osmosis dashboard data were available for all 359 students. All students received the full credit offered for Osmosis engagement, and learning analytics demonstrated regular usage of videos and other digital platform features. Survey responses indicated that most students found Osmosis videos to be helpful for learning (204/232, 87.9%; P=.001) and preferred Osmosis videos to the traditional lecture format (134/232, 57.8%; P<.001). Conclusions: Commercial medical education videos may enhance curriculum with low faculty effort and improve students' learning experiences. Findings from our experience at one medical school can guide the effective use of supplemental digital resources for learning, and related evaluation and research. © 2019 American Academy of Osteopathy.

Numerous studies have, for instance, shown that learning-to-revise is one of the key competences in writing development. Moreover, several models of revision have been developed, and a variety of taxonomies have been used to measure revision in empirical studies. Current advances in data collection and analysis have made it possible to study revision in increasingly precise detail. The present study aimed to combine previous models and current advances by providing a comprehensive product- and process-oriented tagset of revision. The presented tagset includes properties of external revisions: trigger, orientation, evaluation, action, linguistic domain, spatial location, temporal location, duration, and sequencing. We identified how keystroke logging, screen replays, and eye tracking can be used to extract both manually and automatically extract features related to these properties. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how this tagset can be used to annotate revisions made by higher education students in various academic tasks. To conclude, we discuss how this tagset forms a scalable basis for studying revision in writing in depth. © 2021 SAGE Publications.","annotation; eye tracking; keystroke logging; revision processes; writing analytics; writing process","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118277767"

A survey was developed and fielded at eight US higher education institutions, and this article covers the findings from the approximately 2,200 responses. Although most students reported high levels of trust in libraries and librarians, a consistent minority indicated little or no trust at all.

In this editorial, we briefly introduce network science as a field and situate it within learning analytics. Drawing on the Learning Analytics Cycle, we highlight that effective application of network science methods in learning analytics involves critical considerations of learning processes, data, methods and metrics, and interventions, as well as ethics and value systems surrounding these areas. Careful work must meaningfully situate network methods and interventions within the theoretical assumptions explaining learning, as well as within pedagogical and technological factors shaping learning processes. The five empirical papers in the special section demonstrate diverse applications of network analysis, and the invited commentaries from cognitive network science and physics education research further discuss potential synergies between learning analytics and other sister fields with a shared interest in leveraging network science. We conclude by discussing opportunities to strengthen the rigour of network-based learning analytics projects, expand current work into nascent areas, and achieve more impact by holistically addressing the full cycle of learning analytics. © 2022, Society for Learning Analytics Research.

The analysis was performed from different perspectives. First, a descriptive approach was used to analyze technologies that are considered as the most important for the experts and a nonparametric perspective approach was adopted to evaluate variation in the responses according to discipline, region, and years of experience. Second, a decision tree technique was used to establish technology profiles based on when the experts expected that the technologies will impact mass engineering education and the challenges or requirements needed to get widespread use. Third, the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the value of social interest, measured through Google Trends, as a predictor of expert ratings of different technologies. Results indicate adaptive and personalized learning technologies, learning analytics, and open educational resources are the three most promising technologies that will impact engineering education in the short term.

A critical factor contributing to the design of online courses in the higher education settings are well-defined learning objectives that align with course assessments and learning activities. While there are several introspective instruments to evaluate course designs, with the broader adoption of educational technologies and digital tools, there is a wealth of data that offers insights on the alignment of learning objectives to assessments. Such data has paved the way for evidence-based methods of investigating course effectiveness within higher education. This study outlines a methodology for designing and evaluating the alignment between course learning objectives and assessment activities at scale, utilising a combination of learning analytics and measurement theory approaches, more specificially exploratory multi-dimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. We demonstrate the proposed methodology within a professional development MOOC on leadership skills development, where we evaluate the alignemnt between course objectives and reflective writing assessments activities. Our results suggested that the alignment of the existing course objectives to assessment activities can be improved, showing the practical value of the proposed approach.

Trespassing is the leading cause of rail-related fatalities and there has been little progress in reducing the trespassing frequency and deaths for the past ten years in the United States. Although the widespread deployment of surveillance cameras and vast amounts of video data in the railroad industry make witnessing these events achievable, it requires enormous labor-hours to monitor real-time videos or archival video data. To address this challenge and leverage this big data, this study develops a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided framework for the automatic detection of trespassing events. This deep learning-based tool automatically detects trespassing events, differentiates types of violators, generates video clips, and documents basic information of the trespassing events into one dataset. This study aims to provide the railroad industry with state-of-the-art AI tools to harness the untapped potential of video surveillance infrastructure through the risk analysis of their data feeds in specific locations. In the case study, the AI has analyzed over 1,600 h of archival video footage and detected around 3,000 trespassing events from one grade crossing in New Jersey. The data generated from these big video data will potentially help understand human factors in railroad safety research and contribute to specific trespassing proactive safety risk management initiatives and improve the safety of the train crew, rail passengers, and road users through engineering, education, and enforcement solutions to trespassing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Intelligence; Computer vision; Railroad safety; Risk management; Trespassing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124455242"

As a low-cost alternative to the traditional approaches of responding to such crisis, data-driven approaches can help to identify more tailored response strategies and guide towards more informed decision-making. Recently, social media platforms helped researchers and practitioners with sufficient details and coverage to understand how communities respond to natural hazards through social media interactions. However, the empirical literature does not provide any comprehensive guidance on public reactions to active shootings as observed through social media interactions. This study adopted a holistic data analytics approach to collect large-scale social media data from Twitter (~252 K tweets, 04.17.20–05.20.20). The 2020 Nova Scotia Attacks were among the major shooting events observed during this period in addition to the unprecedented experiences people were having due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used several natural language processing and data mining approaches (such as temporal heatmaps, word bigrams, and topic mining) to cluster the social media crisis communication patterns of active shootings and create infographics of the diverse needs, concerns, and reactions observed in the aftermath of such events. Key interactions include bailing out of shooters, shooting investigation, police response, gun violence, lessons learned from the previous school (Sandy Hook) and mass shootings (El Paso), vehicle ramming (Toronto Van Attack), mobility issues, and health concerns during COVID-19 pandemic, changes in economy and education systems. This study would allow first responders and emergency management officials to enhance the capacity of social sharing platforms and facilitate risk communication in no-notice scenarios. Additionally, the infographics could serve as a data dictionary in future active shooting scenarios to maximize peer influence. © 2021 The Author(s)","Active shooting; COVID-19; Machine learning; Social media","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114055170"

However, the importance of linking MOOCs with job market demands has not been explored in the existing literature. This study investigates the role of course relevance in MOOC success by examining the effect of the alignment between courses and job market demands on learner satisfaction. By adopting the DeLone & McLean information system success model as a framework, we propose that course relevance positively influences learner satisfaction. This relationship is moderated by course level and accessibility. We tested our model using information about 1,987 MOOCs and 485 job postings. The results show that learners will be more satisfied with courses if instructors enhance course relevance on trending topics. The effect of relevance is greater for advanced courses and magnified by lifetime accessibility. This paper contributes to MOOC research from three perspectives: 1) it examines the role of course relevance in MOOC success; 2) it points out the importance of considering learners’ characteristics in evaluating MOOC success; 3) it provides valuable guidance on course design, which helps course providers maintain the prosperity of MOOCs in the post-pandemic. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.","Business Analytics; Course Relevance; Learner Satisfaction; MOOCs; Online Learning; Topic Modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143197885"

Innovative application of educational analytics has gained momentum. Indeed, predictive analytics have become increasingly salient in education. Considering the prevalence of learner-system interaction data and the potential value of such data, it is not surprising that significant scholarly attention has been directed at understanding ways of drawing insights from educational data. Although prior literature on educational big data recognizes the utility of deep learning and machine learning methods, little research examines both deep learning and machine learning together, and the differences in predictive performance have been relatively understudied. This paper aims to present a comprehensive comparison of predictive performance using deep learning and machine learning. Specifically, we use educational big data in the context of predicting dropout in MOOCs. We find that machine learning classifiers can predict equally well as deep learning classifiers. This research advances our understanding of the use of deep learning and machine learning in optimizing dropout prediction performance models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Educational big data; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Predictive analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132625617"

Analyzing 18 months of web analytics gave us a preliminary look at who is using the TouchTerrain web application and what their models are used for; and to map out what terrains on the globe they chose to 3D print. From July 2019 to January 2021, more than 20,000 terrain models were downloaded.

Anecdotal evidence points to the strong potential for 3D printed terrain models to provide significant help with specific map-related tasks.

However, it has proven to be elusive to educators within technical domains, such as marketing research and analytics, which has inspired the exploration of experiential course design elements. Client-sponsored projects (CSPs) have become a popular tactic to meet this objective in such courses. The authors utilize a mixed-methods design to examine CSPs and their effectiveness in marketing research and analytics courses. In Study 1, qualitative research yields student insights regarding the desired characteristics of a CSP. Study 2 illustrates that CSPs boost student engagement through perceptions of course relevance. However, students’ subjective interest in the client represented a boundary condition for this effect. That is, CSPs did not offer value to students who lacked inherent interest in the client. In Study 3, a discrete choice model analysis outlined what attributes make clients interesting for students. Finally, Study 4 utilizes a field experiment to identify project-framing tactics that increase student interest through enhanced client familiarity. A series of recommendations are provided to maximize the efficacy of CSPs to marketing research and analytics courses. © The Author(s) 2021.","client-sponsored projects; course content; engagement; experiential learning; interest; marketing education issues; marketing research; mixed methods; relevance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102148978"

Participant progress was tracked over time with CUSUM analytics to establish a learning curve for procedural proficiency. Results: The CUSUM charts for 20 consecutive dry-lab HJ procedures were analysed. A learning curve was created and used to identify areas of weakness to facilitate improvement in technical proficiency. Conclusions: CUSUM is effective tool for objective evaluation of technical dexterity offering both simplicity and adaptability.

Constructing and validating assessments is especially challenging in emergent, fast-growing interdisciplinary STEM fields such as information science. Unlike more traditional STEM fields like physics and mathematics, information science builds on cross-disciplinary connections with multiple pools of domain knowledge. This research investigates how to construct and use assessments to effectively capture knowledge and skills in information science. Our study was conducted in five large information science courses at a U.S. research university on data analytics, web development, visualization, technology design, and natural language processing. We worked with domain experts to develop assessment items at three levels of knowledge: declarative, applied, and transferred (Anderson et al., 2002). The assessments were administered in a pre-post design over two semesters with 1,202 students, with an evidence-based revision of the assessments between the semesters. Our initial findings suggest that some knowledge levels (applied and transferred) may be more suitable for assessing student learning in information science courses. The findings have implications for assessment in emergent interdisciplinary education and inform our plans to develop constructive assessment methods for information science education.

Existing defense methods are passive in the sense that they try to mitigate the negative impact of the poisoned local models instead of eliminating them. In this paper, we leverage the new federated analytics paradigm, to develop a proactive defense method. More specifically, federated analytics is to collectively carry out analytics tasks without disclosing local data of the edge devices. We propose a Federated Anomaly Analytics enhanced Distributed Learning (FAA-DL) framework, where the clients and the server collaboratively analyze the anomalies. FAA-DL firstly detects all the uploaded local models and splits out the potential malicious ones. Then, it verifies each potential malicious local model with functional encryption. Finally, it removes the verified anomalies and aggregates the remaining to produce the global model. We analyze the FAA-DL framework and show that it is accurate, robust, and efficient. We evaluate FAA-DL by training classifiers on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST under various local model poisoning attacks. Our experiment results show FAA-DL improves the accuracy of the learned global model under strong attacks up to 6.90 times and outperforms the state-of-the-art defense methods with a robustness guarantee.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","anomaly detection; Distributed learning; federated analytics; functional encryption; local model poisoning attacks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117321819"

Remote labs provide a possible solution to mitigate this loss. However, most remote labs to date are based on a somehow centralized model in which experts design and conduct certain types of experiments in well-equipped facilities, with a few options of manipulation provided to remote users. In this article, we propose a distributed framework, dubbed remote labs 2.0, that offers the flexibility needed to build an open platform to support educators to create, operate, and share their own remote labs. Similar to the transformation of the Web from 1.0 to 2.0, remote labs 2.0 can greatly enrich experimental science on the Internet by allowing users to choose and contribute their subjects and topics. As a reference implementation, we developed a platform branded as Telelab. In collaboration with a high school chemistry teacher, we conducted remote chemical reaction experiments on the Telelab platform with two online classes. Pre/posttest results showed that these high school students attained significant gains (t(26) = 8.76, p < 0.00001) in evidence-based reasoning abilities. Student surveys revealed the following three key affordances of Telelab: 1) live experiments; 2) scientific instruments; and 3) social interactions. All 31 respondents were engaged by one or more of these affordances. Students' behaviors were characterized by analyzing their interaction data logged by the platform. These findings suggest that appropriate applications of remote labs 2.0 in distance education can, to some extent, reproduce critical effects of their local counterparts on promoting science learning. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","COVID-19; Internet of Things (IoT); learning analytics; learning environments; online learning; remote laboratories; student experiments; thermal sensors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125323003"

Predictive analytics research seeks to build models that identify at-risk students and suggest interventions that enhance student success. This study examines whether incorporating a novel assessment type (concept inventories [CI]) and using machine learning (ML) methods (1) improves prediction quality, (2) reduces the time point of successful prediction, and (3) suggests more actionable course-level interventions. A corpus of university and course-level assessment and non-assessment variables (53 variables in total) from 3225 students (over six semesters) was gathered. Five ML methods were employed (two individuals, three ensembles) at three time points (pre-course, week 3, week 6) to quantify predictive efficacy. Inclusion of course-specific CI data along with university-specific corpora significantly improved prediction performance. Ensemble ML methods, in particular the generalized linear model with elastic net (GLMNET), yielded significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) values compared with non-ensemble techniques. Logistic regression achieved the poorest prediction performance and consistently underperformed. Surprisingly, increasing corpus size (i.e., amount of historical data) did not meaningfully impact prediction success. We discuss the roles that novel assessment types and ML techniques may play in advancing predictive learning analytics and addressing attrition in undergraduate science education. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Concept inventories; Course- vs. institution-specific data sources; Introductory biology; Machine learning; Predictive learning analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098856913"

The algorithm models social learning networks as a function of users knowledge seeking and knowledge disseminating tendencies across course topics and offers a means to optimize social learning networks by connecting users seeking and disseminating information on specific topics. We use the algorithm to analyze the social learning network manifest in the discussion format of a MOOC forum incorporating video lectures and problem assignments. As a measure of the degree that knowledge seekers and knowledge disseminators are connected in the network, we observe a very sparse network with few discussion participants and a limited range of topics. Hence, only small gains are available through optimization, since for a very sparse network, few connections can be made. The development of a metric for the analysis of social learning networks would provide instructors and researchers with a means to optimize online learning environments for empowering social learning.

If we characterize classroom learning between a student and an instructor as a knowledge-intensive service encounter, then students are a kind of “customer” who must interact with the classroom system and play a key role in their own learning. Without engagement and a modicum of satisfaction, student learning plummets. But where to start and how? How might we apply our non-classroom subject matter expertise to the classroom? To overcome students’ negative opinions of the learning process in an operations management course, we applied tried and true principles from service operations management (SOM) to design a better service experience that is more engaging and interesting (without capitulating to the customer being right). Our study involves three phases across two different modalities. We identified and tested key components from SOM that might impact student learning (e.g., customer contact theory, the gap model of service quality, and the psychology of waiting) and linked these components to important suggestions for increasing engagement in the classroom. We then tested how applying the SOM framework improved student satisfaction as measured by assessment of learning and student evaluations. We discovered that applying service design principles to the learning process provides a systematic way to improve student engagement and satisfaction without sacrificing rigor. © 2022 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

One specific area of study is how to increase four- and six-year graduation rates, and the usage of learning analytics to determine student pathways of success. At a flagship Midwestern US university, we studied at-risk populations (specifically, students on or near academic probation) who were enrolled in an academic coaching course. The course focused on identifying self-sabotaging academic habits, learning proven study and time management skills, and working weekly with a personal peer academic coach. These undergraduate peer coaches were specially trained to support the enrolled students by helping to set weekly, specific goals, connecting with campus resources, and discussing the complexities of undergraduate life. We used Qualtrics surveys to determine the impression that enrolled students have of the experience, and found it was overwhelmingly positive. We also used a comparison analytical method to determine whether the class had a significant impact on the enrolled students. We found that there is a small and not significant GPA improvement for enrolled students, and a significant improvement in retention for one and two semesters after taking the course. © 2022 College Reading and Learning Association.","Academic coaching; mentoring; retention; student success; student support; students as partners","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129126221"

This study proposes a novel predictive modeling method to improve model transferability over time within the same course and across different courses. The research gaps addressed are limited evidence showing whether a predictive model built on historical data retrospectively can be directly applied to a future offering of the same course or to another different course; lacking interpretable data mining models to improve model transferability over time and across courses. Three datasets from two distinct online courses with one course offered two times over two years were applied using direct transferring of the predictive model and the proposed Bayesian updating technique for model transfer. The results showed that the direct transferring of predictive model to the subsequent offering of the course and to a totally different course did not work effectively. By contrast, the proposed Bayesian updating provided a robust and interpretable approach with improved model transferability results for both situations. This Bayesian updating model can be continuously updated with new collected data rather than building prediction model from scratch every time, which can serve as a new methodological framework to carry experience and knowledge from past and other courses forward to new courses.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Learning analytics (LA); machine learning; model transferability; online learning; performance prediction.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113822977"

However, there is little empirical evidence about the influence of their design features on learners' cognitive and affective outcomes, especially in high-anxiety courses such as statistics. To address this gap, this study employed a two-group experimental design applied to an authentic setting to assess the influence of task-value scaffolding in a LAD on learners' anxiety, motivation, and learning performance in an online statistics course. This semester-long experiment was implemented in two instances of the course offering (Fall/2019 and Spring/2020) and involved a total of 146 students. The results showed that task-value scaffolding had a negative impact on learners’ computation anxiety and attitudes towards statistics in comparison to the control group. On the other hand, the treatment had no significant influence on other aspects of statistics anxiety, motivation, and learning outcomes. Taken jointly, these results suggest that the use of task-value scaffolding embedded in LADs can have detrimental effects on learners. More experimental studies are necessary to understand the positive and negative effects of LADs with motivational scaffolding. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data science applications in education; Distance education and online learning; Human-computer interface; Pedagogical issues; Post-secondary education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111810944"

Thirst for data about learning is at an all-time high, sometimes without commensurate attention to ensuring principles this community has long valued: privacy, transparency, openness, accountability, and fairness. How we navigate this dynamic context is critical for the future of learning analytics. Thinking about the issue through the lens of JLA publications over the last eight years, we highlight the important contributions of “problem-centric” rather than “toolcentric” research. We also value attention (proximal or distal) to the eventual goal of closing the loop, connecting the results of our analyses back to improve the learning from which they were drawn. Finally, we recognize the power of cycles of maturation: using information generated about real-world uses and impacts of a learning analytics tool to guide new iterations of data, analysis, and intervention design. A critical element of context for such work is that the learning problems we identify and choose to work on are never blank slates; they embed societal structures, reflect the influence of past technologies; and have previous enablers, barriers and social mediation acting on them. In that context, we must ask the hard questions: What parts of existing systems is our work challenging? What parts is it reinforcing? Do these effects, intentional or not, align with our values and beliefs? In the end what makes learning analytics matter is our ability to contribute to progress on both immediate and long-standing challenges in learning, not only improving current systems, but also considering alternatives for what is and what could be. This requires including stakeholder voices in tackling important problems of learning with rigorous analytic approaches to promote equitable learning across contexts. This journal provides a central space for the discussion of such issues, acting as a venue for the whole community to share research, practice, data and tools across the learning analytics cycle in pursuit of these goals. © 2021, UTS ePRESS.

The findings showed significant positive relationships between various tool uses and performance measures and varied tool use patterns at different problem-solving phases by high-and low-performing students. The results indicated that students who used tools appropriately and wisely, given the phase they were at, were more likely to succeed. The findings offered an insightful glimpse of learners’ navigation patterns in relation to their performance and provided much-needed empirical evidence to support using analytics for game-based learning in K–12 education. The findings also revealed that log data cannot explain all learners’ actions. Implications for both research and practice are discussed. © 2022, Society for Learning Analytics Research (SOLAR).

Several colleges and universities use student data analytics to predict student performance. Several endeavors have been conducted to classify student results using well-known algorithms to attain the required accuracy. This article uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to examine and predict the academic characteristics and performance of students based on certain criteria such as prior academic records, family background, and attitudinal information, among others, so that educators can provide solutions in the event of high-risk students failing. Predicting student performance in school has been made possible using ANN, a machine learning model that has been shown to be dependable and effective for a wide range of functions and applications. When compared to other techniques, the results reveal a higher prediction accuracy of 89.72%. It is vital to compare the predictive outcomes with previous solutions in order to examine their fairness, validity, and reliability. When compared to other algorithms on a given dataset, we found that ANN predicts better due to model complexity control and reduction, as well as successive adjustments achieving the highest accuracy, allowing an ANN to produce target output that is more precisely similar to the actual output. © 2022,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences.

To help inform researchers in this area, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of 11 years of research (2010-2021) in student modeling, focusing on learner characteristics, learning indicators, and foundational aspects of dissimilar models. We mainly emphasize increased prediction accuracy when using multidimensional learner data to create multimodal models in real-world adaptive instructional systems. In addition, we discuss challenges inherent in real-world multimodal modeling, such as uncontrolled data collection environments leading to noisy data and data sync issues. Finally, we reinforce our findings and conclusions through an industry case study of an adaptive instructional system. In our study, we verify that adding multiple data modalities increases our model prediction accuracy from 53.3% to 69%. At the same time, the challenges encountered with our real-world case study, including uncontrolled data collection environment with inevitably noisy data, calls for synchronization and noise control strategies for data quality and usability.  © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive instructional systems; Multimodal learning analytics; Student modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131738112"

States annually report on post-high school outcomes (PSO) of exited students. This study sought to fill two gaps in the literature related to PSO for exited high-school students with ASD and the use of state data and predictive modeling. Methods: Data from two states were analyzed using two predictive analytics (PA) methods: multilevel logistic regression and machine learning. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to assess predictive performance. Results: Data analyses produced two results. One, the strongest predictor of PSO for exited students with ASD was graduating from high school. Two, machine learning performed better than multilevel logistic regression in predicting PSO engagement across the two states. Conclusion: This study contributed two new and important findings to the literature: (a) PA models should be applied to state PSO data because they produce useful information, and (b) PA models are accurate and reliable over time. Implications: These findings can be used to support state and local educators to make decisions about policies, programs, and practices for exited high school students with ASD, to help them successfully transition to adult life. © The Author(s) 2022.","Autism spectrum disorder; machine learning; multilevel logistic regression; post-school outcomes; predictive analytics; receiver operating characteristic curve","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128635546"

This testing effect can be leveraged by spacing out the testing practice over time, a technique called spaced repetition. In 2017, we provided dental students at the school with access to Osmosis, a web-based platform that supports test-enhanced learning and spaced repetition through flashcards. This exploratory study examined students’ adoption of self-testing with flashcards and its impact on learning performance in basic sciences. Methods: Participants were 143 first-year predoctoral students at a dental school in the US. The platform analytics revealed the number of flashcards students answered throughout the first academic year (2019–2020). Regression analyses examined how self-testing with flashcards impacted students’ exam scores in basic sciences. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests examined the difference in students’ exam performance among the non, minimal, occasional, and regular flashcard users who answered 0, 1–99, 100–499, and over 500 flashcards, respectively. Results: Students answered 82,766 flashcards during the year. Additionally, they created 17,973 flashcards using the platform's flashcard authoring tool. Regression analyses showed that self-testing with flashcards correlated positively with students’ exam performance in anatomy, biochemistry, nutrition, and physiology. ANOVA results revealed a statistically significant difference in students’ exam performance in anatomy, biochemistry, and nutrition among the four groups. Conclusions: This study is the first in dental education to examine students’ self-testing on the Osmosis platform. Results revealed that there was widespread adoption of self-testing with flashcards. The study provided additional evidence to support the value of self-testing for dental students. It has practical implications of how test-enhanced learning can be incorporated into dental education to support student learning. The study contributed to the test-enhanced learning literature in dental education, an area that has been underexplored. © 2022 The Authors.

This sequential explanatory mixed-methods study evaluated potential benefits and pitfalls of CBD in Canadian neurosurgery residency education. Methods: Two four-month interval surveys were distributed to all Canadian neurosurgery residents participating in CBD. The surveys assessed important educational components: CBD knowledge of key stakeholders, potential system barriers, and educational/psychological impacts on residents. Paired t-tests were done to assess changes over time. Based on longitudinal survey responses, semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate in-depth residents’ experience with CBD in neurosurgery. The qualitative analysis followed an explanatory approach, and a thematic analysis was performed. Results: Surveys had 82% average response rate (n = 25). Over time, most residents self-reported that they retrospectively understood concepts around CBD intentions (p = 0.02). Perceived benefits included faculty evaluations with more feedback that was clearer and more objective (53% and 51%). Pitfalls included the amount of time needed to navigate through EPAs (90%) and residents forgetting to initiate EPA forms (71%). There was no significant change over time. During interviews, five key themes were found. Potential solutions identified by residents to enhance their experience included learning analytics data availability, mobile app refinement, and dedicated time to integrate EPAs in the workflow. Conclusion: This study was the first to assess resident-perceived benefits and pitfalls of the neurosurgery CBD training program in an educational framework context. In general, residents believed that theoretical principles behind CBD were valuable, but that technological ability and having enough time to request EPA assessments were significant barriers to success.

Driven by developments in the emerging field of learning analytics, these technologies adjust problems based on learners' performance. Yet, until now it is largely unclear how students regulate their learning with ALTs. Hence, we explored how learners regulate their effort, accuracy and learning with an ALT using moment-by-moment learning curves. The results indicated that moment-by-moment learning curves did reflect students’ accuracy and learning, but no associations with effort were found. Immediate drops were associated with high prior knowledge and suboptimal learning. Immediate peaks were associated with robust learning and pointed to effective student regulation. Close multiple spikes showed moderate learning and lower initial levels of accuracy but, with system support, these students seemed able to regulate their learning. Separated multiple spikes indicated reduced learning and accuracy and potentially signal the inability of students to regulate their learning. In this light, moment-by-moment learning curves seem to be valuable indicators of accuracy regulation during learning with ALTs and could potentially be used in interventions to support SRL with personalized visualizations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive learning technologies; Learning analytics; Primary education; Self-regulated learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067485818"

Through this experience of the new educational ecology, educators have learned many lessons, including how to navigate through uncertainty by recognizing their strengths and vulnerabilities. In this context, the aim of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the publications covering COVID-19 and education to analyze the impact of the pandemic by applying the data mining and analytics techniques of social network analysis and text-mining. From the abstract, title, and keyword analysis of a total of 1150 publications, seven themes were identified: (1) the great reset, (2) shifting educational landscape and emerging educational roles (3) digital pedagogy, (4) emergency remote education, (5) pedagogy of care, (6) social equity, equality, and injustice, and (7) future of education. Moreover, from the citation analysis, two thematic clusters emerged: (1) educational response, emergency remote education affordances, and continuity of education, and (2) psychological impact of COVID-19. The overlap between themes and thematic clusters revealed researchers’ emphasis on guaranteeing continuity of education and supporting the socio-emotional needs of learners. From the results of the study, it is clear that there is a heightened need to develop effective strategies to ensure the continuity of education in the future, and that it is critical to proactively respond to such crises through resilience and flexibility. © 2022, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","Coronavirus pandemic; COVID-19; Education during the pandemic; Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; Teaching and learning in the new normal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133422612"

This systematic review of 166 articles from 2011–2021 synthesizes the trends and critical issues of LA in MOOCs. The eight-step process proposed by Okoli and Schabram was used to guide this systematic review in analyzing publication outlets, research purposes and methods, stakeholders, and researchers’ geographic locations and subjects. The review showed that MOOC LA research is primarily published in top-tier journals, such as the Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, and Computers & Education, as well as conference proceedings. The review also revealed that LA in MOOCs was used more frequently for the purpose of research than for practice (i.e., learning and teaching). Approximately 60% of the reviewed studies adopted learners’ log data and achievement data as the primary data sources. Statistics, machine learning, content analysis, social network analysis, text analysis, and data visualization were the top six specific data analysis techniques used in the MOOC LA studies. Regarding collaboration, more than half of the reviewed studies involved interdisciplinary collaborations, and approximately one-third involved international collaborations. We suggested future studies on MOOC LA interventions to improve learning and teaching practices, and the active interdisciplinary collaboration to increase the rigor of the studies and the dissemination of the knowledge. More detailed discussion and implications for research and practice are presented. This research provides insights on future research and practices regarding LA use in MOOCs. © 2022, The Author(s).","Analysis techniques; Learning analytics; MOOCs; Systematic review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128090633"

Various student-facing systems increased the amount of data available to students, and whether students can use big data and learning analytics effectively will affect their academic success. Most studies, however, have focused on how teachers and administrative personnel use student data to make data-driven instruction and management decisions. As a result, little attention has been given to students' use of relevant data that generated by big data and learning analytics to promote their own learning and growth. This study explored using social cognitive theory to identify possible environmental, personal, and behavioural factors that affect students' data use. We used an online questionnaire that collected 242 completed surveys from Chinese university students. Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modelling was used to analyse the data. The initial findings support the conclusion that university students could be encouraged to effectively use data in three ways: (1) through the promotion of university-wide cultures of data use and sustained improvements in data quality, (2) through the professional development of student data literacy, and (3) through the support of student data autonomy, student data reflectiveness, and students' digital identities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","data-driven decision; e-learning; ease of use perceptions and behavioural intentions; Use of data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107639252"

However, it remains unknown which themes in narrative data that occur early in training may indicate a higher likelihood of struggles later in training, allowing programs to intervene sooner. Methods: Using learning analytics, we identified 26 internal medicine residents in three cohorts that were below expected entrustment during training. We compiled all narrative data in the first 6 months of training for these residents as well as 13 typically performing residents for comparison. Narrative data were blinded for all 39 residents during initial phases of an inductive thematic analysis for initial coding. Results: Many similarities were identified between the two cohorts. Codes that differed between typical and lower entrusted residents were grouped into two types of themes: three explicit/manifest and three implicit/latent with six total themes. The explicit/manifest themes focused on specific aspects of resident performance with assessors describing 1) Gaps in attention to detail, 2) Communication deficits with patients, and 3) Difficulty recognizing the “big picture” in patient care. Three implicit/latent themes, focused on how narrative data were written, were also identified: 1) Feedback described as a deficiency rather than an opportunity to improve, 2) Normative comparisons to identify a resident as being behind their peers, and 3) Warning of possible risk to patient care. Discussion: Clinical competency committees (CCCs) usually rely on accumulated data and trends. Using the themes in this paper while reviewing narrative comments may help CCCs with earlier recognition and better allocation of resources to support residents’ development. © 2021, The Author(s).","Assessment; Competency committees; Competency-based medical education; Narrative data; Qualitative research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114105722"

However, there is a lack of work to support educators in making data-informed design decisions when designing a blended course and planning appropriate learning activities. In this paper, we introduce knowledge-based design analytics that uncover facets of the learning activities that are being created. A knowledge-based visualization is integrated into edCrumble, a (blended) learning design authoring tool. This new approach is explored in the context of a higher education programming course, where instructors design labs and home practice sessions with online smart learning content on a weekly basis. We performed a within-subjects user study to compare the use of the design tool both with and without visualization. We studied the differences in terms of cognitive load, controllability, confidence and ease of choice, design outcomes, and user actions within the system to compare both conditions with the objective of evaluating the impact of using design analytics during the decision-making phase of course design. Our results indicate that the use of a knowledge-based visualization allows the teachers to reduce the cognitive load (especially in terms of mental demand) and that it facilitates the choice of the most appropriate activities without affecting the overall design time. In conclusion, the use of knowledge-based design analytics improves the overall learning design quality and helps teachers avoid committing design errors. © 2021, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Authoring tool; Blended learning; Concept-level visualization; Design analytics; Knowledge-based analytics; Learning design; Smart learning content","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106517080"

It is possible to collect and analyze learning logs even in classes with many learners, including clickstreams and quiz scores in detail for each individual. This research proposes using Moodle's learning logs to classify learning patterns and outliers in order to identify struggling learners. The proposed method uses the descriptive statistics between the learner's teaching material clickstream and the final test score accumulated in Moodle, and students can be classified into four learning patterns. The frequency of each learning pattern was correlated with the appearance of outliers in the final test score and the teaching material clickstream. Most learners moved through four learning patterns during the weekly lessons, however, some learners scoring at the top and bottom of the weekly quiz scores repeated the same learning patterns.

There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Computational analysis; Computational thinking skills; Computer education; Computer programming; Self-regulated learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101403049"

More and more researchers are using these platforms to conduct A/B tests on the impact of different designs, and multiple scientific communities have emerged around studying the big data becoming available from these platforms. However, it is not yet fully understood how each type of research influences future scientific discourse within the broader field. To address this gap, this paper presents the first scientometric study on how researchers build on the contributions of these two types of online learning platform research (particularly in STEM education). We selected a pair of papers (one using A/B testing, the other conducting learning analytics (LA), on platform data of an online STEM education platform), published in the same year, by the same research group, at the same conference. We then analyzed each of the papers that cited these two papers, coding from the paper text (with inter-rater reliability checks) the reason for each citation made. Results: After statistically comparing the frequency of each category of citation between papers, we found that the A/B test paper was self-cited more and that citing papers built on its work directly more frequently, whereas the LA paper was more often cited without discussion. Conclusions: Hence, the A/B test paper appeared to have had a larger impact on future work than the learning analytics (LA) paper, even though the LA paper had a higher count of total citations with a lower degree of self-citation. This paper also established a novel method for understanding how different types of research make different contributions in learning analytics, and the broader online learning research space of STEM education. © 2022, The Author(s).","A/B testing; Learning analytics; Online learning; Scientometrics; STEM education platform","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124976510"

To advance this field, this paper describes the lessons learned from having designed and implemented a CA tool to help managers and teaching staff reflect on curriculum and teaching practices. This CA tool was developed under a design-based research approach called The Integrative Learning Design Framework. We implemented a two-cycle building-testing structure to evaluate the perceived usefulness and usability of this tool. The first cycle consisted of designing a first version of the tool and evaluating its use throughout a case study involving 5 managers and 124 teaching staff members who participated in a 3-year continuous improvement process in one Latin American university. The second cycle consisted of redesigning the tool according to the lessons learned during the first cycle and evaluating its use throughout workshops with 16 managers and 9 teaching staff members in two Latin American universities. Findings indicate that the CA tool helped teachers collect a greater number and variety of evidence regarding students’ attainment of competencies, allowing staff to be more aware of the learning situation of their students when redesigning course assessment methods and course sequences. Currently, this CA tool is being used by 20 Latin American universities, guiding curriculum renewal strategies beyond the current global pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Continuous curriculum improvement; Design-based research; Higher education; Learning analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127515160"

Protecting student privacy is paramount, but progress in increasing scientific understanding and improving educational outcomes depends upon open, scalable and replicable research. Findings have repeatedly been shown to be contextually dependent on personal and demographic variables, so how can we use this data in a manner that is ethical and secure for all involved? This paper presents ongoing work on the MOOC Replication Framework (MORF), a big data repository and analysis environment for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We discuss MORF's approach to protecting student privacy, which allows researchers to use data without having direct access. Through an open API, documentation and tightly controlled outputs, this framework provides researchers with the opportunity to perform secure, scalable research and facilitates collaboration, replication, and novel research. We also highlight ways in which MORF represents a solution template to issues surrounding privacy and security in the age of big data in education and key challenges still to be tackled. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Personal Identifying Information (PII) has many valid and important research uses in education. The ability to replicate or build on analyses is important to modern educational research, and is usually enabled through sharing data. Data sharing generally does not involve PII in order to protect student privacy. MOOCs present a rich data source for education researchers to better understand online learning. What this paper adds The MOOC replication framework (MORF) 2.1 is a new infrastructure that enables researchers to conduct analyses on student data without having direct access to the data, thus protecting student privacy. Detail of the MORF 2.1 structure and workflow. Implications for practice and/or policy MORF 2.1 is available for use by practitioners and research with policy implications. The infrastructure and approach in MORF could be applied to other types of educational data. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.","data repository; data sharing; MOOC data; MOOC Replication Framework (MORF); open educational science; personal identifying information; privacy-protecting infrastructure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130046510"

However, the ill-structured and open-ended nature of engineering design makes it difficult for an instructor to keep track of the design processes of all students simultaneously and provide personalized feedback on a timely basis. This study proposes a Bayesian network model to dynamically and automatically assess students’ engagement with engineering design tasks and to support formative feedback. Specifically, we applied a Bayesian network to 111 ninth-grade students’ process data logged by a computer-aided design software program that students used to solve an engineering design challenge. Evidence was extracted from the log files and fed into the Bayesian network to perform inferential reasoning and provide a barometer of their performance in the form of posterior probabilities. Results showed that the Bayesian network model was competent at predicting a student’s task performance. It performed well in both identifying students of a particular group (recall) and ensuring identified students were correctly labeled (precision). This study also suggests that Bayesian networks can be used to pinpoint a student’s strengths and weaknesses for applying relevant science knowledge to engineering design tasks. Future work of implementing this tool within the computer-aided design software will provide instructors a powerful tool to facilitate engineering design through automatically generating personalized feedback to students in real time. © The Author(s) 2020.","assessment; Bayesian network; educational data mining; engineering design; learning analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091452576"

However, there appears to be a paucity of research on the AI curriculum. This study examines the current status of the AI curriculum in both undergraduate and graduate business schools and provides recommendations for future AI curriculum development. The study develops a technical competency model for AI curriculum based on both MSIS2016 - Global Competency Model for Graduate Degree Programs in Information Systems and IS2020 - A Competency Model for Undergraduate Programs in Information Systems and the AI technical competencies. Using text mining analysis, we collected and analyzed AI courses from the top 46 business schools at both undergraduate and graduate levels, ranked by US News in 2020. The findings indicate that machine learning is at the core of the AI curriculum in business, and most AI curricula are a hybrid of AI and data analytics. This acknowledges that the AI curriculum is still at its early stage, and business schools are closely adhering to the industrial development trend. The proposed technical competency model for AI curriculum can serve as a guideline for future AI curriculum development in business schools. We hope this study provides systematic insight into AI curriculum and offers recommendations for business education, in IS programs specifically. © 2022 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

Which cases to supply to which learners in which order is still to be worked out, with there being considerable potential for adapting the learning. Advances in statistical modeling, based on an accumulating learning curve, offer methods for more effectively pairing learners with cases of known calibrations. Using demonstration radiograph and electrocardiogram datasets, the advantages of moving from traditional regression to multilevel methods for modeling growth in ability or performance are demonstrated, with a final step of integrating case-level item-response information based on diagnostic grouping. This produces more precise individual-level estimates that can eventually support learner adaptive case selection. The progressive increase in model sophistication is not simply statistical but rather brings the models into alignment with core learning principles including the importance of taking into account individual differences in baseline skill and learning rate as well as the differential interaction with cases of varying diagnosis and difficulty. The developed approach can thus give researchers and educators a better basis on which to anticipate learners’ pathways and individually adapt their future learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive Learning; Electrocardiograms; Item-response theory; Learning curves; Multi-level modelling; Predictive analytics; Radiology; Statistical modelling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101850801"

In this software, users can interactively compare latent variable methods such as Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Principal Component Regression (PCR) with other regression methods such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso), Ridge Regression (RR), and Elastic Net (EN). LAVADE helps to build intuition on choosing appropriate methods, hyperparameter tuning, and model coefficient interpretation, fostering a conceptual understanding of the algorithms’ differences. The software contains a data generation method and three chemical process datasets, allowing for comparing results of datasets with different levels of complexity. LAVADE is released as open-source software so that others can apply and advance the tool for use in teaching or research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data analytics; Education; Machine learning; Software; Teaching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139734727"

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no exception. The implications of changing activity and language take on new gravity in certain fields to which AI is applied, such as education (AIEd). Terms like smart, intelligence, and learning, which had certain meanings when describing human cognition, take on new meanings in the context of computational systems, with the potential for polysemy when the human and computational meanings meet. This article unpacks what AIEd companies mean when they use these terms. Drawing on findings from a mixed-methods study, we first describe how AIEd companies used these terms on two websites. Then, using Natural Language Processing techniques, we quantitatively analyse a corpus of over 65,000 words scraped from 26 AIEd company websites. Our analyses suggest that commonly promoted narratives around student learning and 21st Century skill-building are not supported by the language on AIEd company websites, which focus instead on mass customization, efficiency, and monitoring—all tasks at which computers excel. Also, notably scarce in the corpus were extensive articulations on ethics. Given these findings we propose that although AIEd companies create powerful new technical possibilities, they must also be evaluated for the powerful ways in which they shape narratives around the use of technology in education and the behaviours and capabilities that constitute education. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141495341"

Since it is evident that the growth in technology and innovation rapidly changes the nature of data-centric jobs, organizations must put in a lot of effort to train their employees, especially in cloud-based sustainable work environments. Aligning academic curricula with industry requirements has been a necessity more than an option for providing sustainable solutions. Therefore, academia and companies should work together to address real-world challenges, saving a lot of money, time, and effort along with tremendous changes in the education sector. The main objective of this research paper is to explore pilot studies by designing projectbased courses specific to the data science disciplines for the students by examining current research innovations in technology and industry guidance and collaboration. To achieve this objective, we introduced courses in data science by proposing a Sustainable Data-Centric Project Curriculum. Industry-academia collaboration and offering courses relevant to current technologies play an essential role in cultivating a highly skilled workforce. Offering such courses will prepare students in computing disciplines (CSE, IT, and Data Science) to acquire the data analytics foundation to create an industry-ready workforce. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer’s work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined. © 2020, The Author(s).","AIED; Course learning design; Intervention; Learning analytics; Learning data; Self-paced online learning; Student modelling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097441412"

Simultaneously, the volume of data available to educators and scholars interested in online learning continues to rise. This study seeks to extend learning analytics applications typically oriented toward understanding student interaction with course content, instructors, and peers to the program level in order to gain insight into the ways in which adult learners manage their learning progress over multiple courses and multiple semesters. Using optimal matching analysis, we identify four distinct profiles of course enrollment behaviour among 1,801 successful graduates of an online master’s program that differ with respect to course load, semesters off, and graduation speed. We found that profiles differed significantly as a function of age and knowledge background, but not with respect to gender, ethnicity, or previous academic performance. Findings indicate the utility of expanding learning analytics focused on the micro-level of analysis to the macro-level of analysis and the utility of grounding learning analytics applications geared toward adult learners in a lifespan development perspective.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fair AI; learning analytics; machine learning; online learning","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136886559"

Outside of clinical experience, graduate medical education provides a handful of explicit activities focused on developing skills in clinical reasoning. Objective: In this paper, we describe the development, use, and changing perceptions of a web-based asynchronous tool to facilitate clinical reasoning discussion for PEM providers. Methods: We created a case-based web-based discussion tool for PEM clinicians and fellows to post and discuss cases. We examined website analytics for site use and collected user survey data over a 3-year period to assess the use and acceptability of the tool. Results: The learning tool had more than 30,000 site visits and 172 case comments for the 55 published cases over 3 years. Self-reported engagement with the learning tool varied inversely with clinical experience in PEM. The tool was relevant to clinical practice and useful for learning PEM for most respondents. The most experienced clinicians were more likely than fellows to report posting commentary, although absolute rate of commentary was low. Conclusions: An asynchronous method of case presentation and web-based commentary may present an acceptable way to supplement clinical experience and traditional education methods for sharing clinical reasoning. ©Sonny Tat, Haroon Shaukat, Pavan Zaveri, Maybelle Kou, Lenore Jarvis.","asynchronous learning; clinical reasoning; emergency medicine; pediatrics; web-based learning tool","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145611253"

The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) - including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics - as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); big data; blockchain; COVID-19; digital twin; eHealth; healthcare; Internet of Things (IoT); pandemic; robotics; wearable","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104588125"

For example, LA systems utilizing computerized formative assessments can be used for monitoring students’ progress in reading and identifying struggling readers. Using such LA systems, teachers can also determine whether progress is adequate as the student works towards their instructional goal. However, due to the lack of guidelines on the timing, number, and frequency of computerized formative assessments, teachers often follow a one-size-fits-all approach by testing all students together on pre-determined dates. This approach leads to a rigid test scheduling that ignores the pace at which students improve their reading skills. In some cases, the consequence is testing that yields little to no useful data, while increasing the amount of instructional time that students miss. In this study, we propose an intelligent recommender system (IRS) based on Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm that can produce an optimal assessment schedule for each student based on their reading progress throughout the school year. We demonstrated the feasibility of the IRS using real data from a large sample of students in grade two (n = 668,324) and grade four (n = 727,147) who participated in a series of computerized reading assessments. Also, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the IRS in the presence of unusual growth trajectories in reading (e.g., negative growth, no growth, and plateau). Our results showed that the IRS could reduce the number of test administrations required at both grade levels by eliminating test administrations in which students’ reading growth did not change substantially. In addition, the simulation results indicated that the IRS could yield robust results with meaningful recommendations under relatively extreme growth trajectories. Implications for the use of recommender systems in K–12 education and recommendations for future research are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

However, their effects largely depend on student-related factors, the most prominent being their behavioral characteristics as they play the games. In this study, we applied a set of learning analytics methods (k-means clustering, data visualization) to clickstream data from an interactive online algebra game to unpack how middle-school students’ (N = 227) behavioral patterns (i.e., the number of problems completed, resetting problems, reattempting problems, pause time before first actions) correlated with their understanding of mathematical equivalence. The k-means cluster analysis identified four groups of students based on their behavioral patterns in the game: fast progressors, intermediate progressors, slow progressors, and slow-steady progressors. The results indicated that students in these clusters, with the exception of slow progressors, showed significant increases in their understanding of mathematical equivalence. In particular, slow-steady progressors, who reattempted the same problem more often than other students, showed the largest absolute learning gains, suggesting that behavioral engagement played a significant role in learning. With data visualizations, we presented evidence of variability in students’ approaches to problem solving in the game, providing future directions for investigating how differences in student behaviors impact learning. © 2022, Crown.","Cluster analysis; Data visualization; Educational games; Mathematics education; Middle-school mathematics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135343692"

We focus on healthcare due to its economic importance worldwide. The efficient exploratory analysis of healthcare data constitutes a significant challenge. Key concerns in public health include the quick identification and analysis of trends and the detection of outliers. This allows policies to be rapidly adapted to changing circumstances. We present an efficient outlier detection technique, termed PIKS (Pruned iterative-k means searchlight), which combines an iterative k-means algorithm with a pruned searchlight based scan. We apply this technique to identify outliers in two publicly available healthcare datasets from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, and California’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. We provide a comparison of our technique with three other existing outlier detection techniques, consisting of auto-encoders, isolation forests, and feature bagging. We identified outliers in conditions including suicide rates, immunity disorders, social admissions, cardiomyopathies, and pregnancy in the third trimester. We demonstrate that the PIKS technique produces results consistent with other techniques such as the auto-encoder. However, the auto-encoder needs to be trained, which requires several parameters to be tuned. In comparison, the PIKS technique has far fewer parameters to tune. This makes it advantageous for fast, “out-of-the-box” data exploration. The PIKS technique is scalable and can readily ingest new datasets. Hence, it can provide valuable, up-to-date insights to citizens, patients, and policy-makers. We have made our code open source, and with the availability of open data, other researchers can easily reproduce and extend our work. This will help promote a deeper understanding of healthcare policies and public health issues. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Big data analytics; Exploratory data analysis; Machine learning; Open healthcare data; Outlier detection; Policy making; Trend analysis; Unsupervised clustering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131824131"

To understand the reasons behind these failures we analyze the raw data of a trusted pollster which failed to predict, along with the rest of the pollsters, the surprising 2019 presidential election in Argentina. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from longitudinal surveys performed before and after the elections reveals clear biases related to mis-representation of the population and, most importantly, to social-desirability biases, i.e., the tendency of respondents to hide their intention to vote for controversial candidates. We propose an opinion tracking method based on machine learning models and big-data analytics from social networks that overcomes the limits of traditional polls. This method includes three prediction models based on the loyalty classes of users to candidates, homophily measures and re-weighting scenarios. The model achieves accurate results in the 2019 Argentina elections predicting the overwhelming victory of the candidate Alberto Fernández over the incumbent president Mauricio Macri, while none of the traditional pollsters was able to predict the large gap between them. Beyond predicting political elections, the framework we propose is more general and can be used to discover trends in society, for instance, what people think about economics, education or climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial Intelligence; Big-data analytics; Election prediction; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Opinion analysis; Social networks; Social-desirability biases","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117696864"

This study used LMS data to explore the frequency of interaction between instructors and students in discussion boards in online courses at one institution. Overall, 415 courses were analyzed spanning two semesters. Results from the study found that the average number of posts by an instructor was 32.9. The average instructor interaction was 1.49 instructor posts per student. 23% of courses had no instructor posts. Student posts averaged 470 per course and the average posts per student was 19.9. Based on the discussion board activity, the most discussion interaction occurred during the first two weeks of the semester. Results also suggested that there is no relationship between student satisfaction and the number of total posts in a course.

A nexus of data ethics issues is the concept of creep, or repurposing of data for other applications or research beyond the conditions of original collection. Data creep has proven controversial and has prompted concerns about the scope of ethical oversight. Institutional review boards offer little guidance regarding big data, and problematic research can still meet ethical standards. While ethics seem concrete through institutional deployment, I frame ethics as produced. Informed by my ethnographic research at a large public university in the U.S., I explore ethics through two models: ethics as institutional procedures and ethics as acts and intentions. The university where I conducted fieldwork is the development grounds for a predictive model that uses student data to anticipate academic success. While students consent to data collection, the circumstances of consent and the degree to which they are informed are not so apparent, as many data are a product of creep. Drawing from interviews and participant observation with administrators, data scientists, developers, and students, I examine data ethics, from a larger institutional model to everyday enactments related to data creep. After demonstrating the limits of such models, I propose a remodeling of ethics that draws on recent works on data, justice, and refusal to pose generative questions for rethinking ethics in institutional contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Big data ethics; Data creep; Justice; Learning analytics; Predictive modeling; Universities","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119399833"

Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of frontline physicians with a range of experience levels interpreted 200 pCXR presented using a customized online radiograph presentation platform. Participants were asked to determine absence or presence (with respective location) of pneumonia. The pCXR were categorized for specific image-based variables potentially associated with interpretation difficulty. We also generated heat maps displaying the locations of diagnostic error among normal pCXR. Finally, we compared image review processes in participants with higher versus lower levels of clinical experience. Results: We enrolled 83 participants (20 medical students, 40 postgraduate trainees, and 23 faculty) and obtained 12,178 case interpretations. Variables that predicted for increased pCXR interpretation difficulty were pneumonia versus no pneumonia (β = 8.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.4 to 10.0), low versus higher visibility of pneumonia (β = –2.2, 95% CI = –2.7 to –1.7), nonspecific lung pathology (β = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.40 to 1.5), localized versus multifocal pneumonia (β = –0.5, 95% CI = –0.8 to –0.1), and one versus two views (β = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.01 to 1.9). A review of diagnostic errors identified that bony structures, vessels in the perihilar region, peribronchial thickening, and thymus were often mistaken for pneumonia. Participants with lower experience were less accurate when they reviewed one of two available views (p < 0.0001), and accuracy of those with higher experience increased with increased confidence in their response (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Using learning analytics, we identified actionable learning opportunities for pCXR interpretation, which can be used to allow for a customized weighting of which cases to practice. Furthermore, experienced–novice comparisons revealed image review processes that were associated with greater diagnostic accuracy, providing additional insight into skill development of image interpretation. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","education; learning analytics; medical; radiographs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105094977"

The emerging multi-user CAD (MUCAD) systems allow virtual, real-time collaboration, with the potential to expand the learning outcomes and teaching methods of CAD. This paper proposes a MUCAD collaborative learning framework (MUCAD-CLF) to interpret backend analytic data from commercially available MUCAD software. The framework builds on several existing metrics from the literature and introduces newly developed methods to classify CAD actions collected from users’ analytic data. The framework contains two different classification approaches of user actions, categorizing actions by action type (e.g., creating, revising, viewing) and by design space (e.g., constructive, organizing), for comparative analysis. Next, the analytical framework is applied via a collaborative design challenge, corresponding to over 20,000 actions collected from 31 participants. Illustrative analyses utilizing the MUCAD-CLF are presented to demonstrate the resulting insight. Differences in CAD behaviour, indicating differences in learning, are observed between teams made up entirely of novices, entirely of experienced users, or a mix. In pairs of experts and novices, we see both a perceived high-satisfaction apprenticeship experience for the novices and preliminary evidence of an increase in expert design behaviours for the novices. The proposed framework is critical for MUCAD systems to make the most of the educational possibility of combining technical skill-building with team collaboration. Preliminary evidence collected in a fully-virtual design learning activity, and analyzed using the proposed MUCAD-CLF, shows that novice students gain advanced CAD design knowledge when collaborating with experienced teammates. With the user data captured by modern MUCAD software and the MUCAD-CLF presented herein, instructors and researchers can more efficiently assess and visualize students’ performance over the design learning process. © 2021","CAD education; Collaborative learning; Computer-aided design; Data mining; Multi-user CAD; User analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119004706"

Sweeping changes in technology and society have certainly affected how marketing research is designed and implemented—but how has this affected teaching of this important topic? Although the purpose of marketing research is still to better understand target customer needs, the tools are different now: customer data are typically collected using technology-based interfaces in place of such instruments as mailed, telephone, or in-person surveys. Observational techniques collect more data electronically rather than requiring a human recorder. Similarly, sampling has changed: sample frames are no longer widely used. Many of these changes are not yet fully discussed in marketing research courses. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in and availability of courses and programs in marketing data analytics, which teach specialized skills related to analysis and interpretation of electronic databases. Perhaps even more importantly, new technology-based tools permit greater automation of data collection and analysis, and presentation of findings. A critical gap is identified in this article; specifically, effort is needed to better integrate the perspectives of data collection and data analysis given current research conditions. © The Author(s) 2020.","change over time; course content; depth interviews; learning approaches and issues; level/type of education; marketing education issues; marketing education issues; marketing education issues; marketing research; undergraduate education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091300940"

Intentional design of the data collection can enable iterative testing of an instructional design. In this study, we propose that across a population of learners the information from multiple choice question responses can help to identify which design features are associated with positive learner engagement. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that, within an online module that presents serial knowledge content, measures of click-level behavior will show sufficient, but variable, association with a test-measure so as to potentially guide instructional design. Method: The Aquifer online learning platform employs interactive approaches to enable effective learning of health professions content. A multidisciplinary focus group of experts identified potential learning analytic measures within an Aquifer learning module, including: hyperlinks clicked (yes/no), magnify buttons clicked (yes/no), expert advice links clicked (yes/no), and time spent on each page (seconds). Learning analytics approaches revealed which click-level data was correlated with the subsequent relevant Case MCQ. We report regression coefficients where the dependent variable is student accuracy on the Case MCQ as a general indicator of successful engagement. Results: Clicking hyperlinks, magnifying images, clicking “expert” links, and spending '100 seconds on each page were learning analytic measures and were positively correlated with Case MCQ success; rushing through pages ('20 seconds) was inversely correlated with success. Conversely, for some measures, we failed to find expected associations. Conclusions: In online learning environments, the wealth of process data available offers insights for instructional designers to iteratively hone the effectiveness of learning. Learning analytic measures of engagement can provide feedback as to which interaction elements are effective. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","instructional design; learning analytics; medical education; Online learning; radiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084859070"

The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist).

Compared with other context aware learning applications, this is the first time tablet-based navigation gestures have been used to support learning assessment. We conducted a 21 participant user study, showing the system can predict how users respond to test questions with 87.7% accuracy without user-specific calibration data.

Cognitive processing, a category variable generated by the automated text analysis tool, Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), is made up of six sub-scores (insight, causation, discrepancy, tentativeness, certainty and differentiation). Clout is a nontransparent summary variable in LIWC that can be used to understand the level of confidence conveyed in the text. Because clout is nontransparent, we do not know the algorithm used to calculate its value. To better understand this variable, this study examined cognitive processing alongside clout. In this study, a series of linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate, after controlling for gender, degree and type of post, if the focal relationship between each sub-score of cognitive processing as the predictor variables and clout as the dependent variable changed across courses with different pacing (self-paced or instructor-paced). Next, the focal relationship between each predictor and clout was examined with or without regard to pacing.

Additionally, some research has found that learners who are DHH have poor autonomous learning skills. The Deaf STEM Community Alliance, a project supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF HRD-1127955), created a model virtual (online) academic community called the DHH Virtual Academic Community to directly address preparation, socialization, and access challenges with the logic that online resources provide innovative and flexible means to adapt to complex student needs and schedules. This article describes a mixed-method study regarding one instructor’s effort to supplement developmental math education with online videos for students who are DHH, addressing issues relating to the challenges of preparation and access. Data analysis used both quantitative and qualitative methods to interpret student responses (n = 89) about viewing behaviors and perceived benefits of the videos. Analysis of viewing behaviors also incorporated aggregated user analytics generated by YouTube. An unexpected finding of the study relates to the opportunity to develop autonomous learning skills by using the videos. While previous research with this student population has frequently found that students are teacher dependent, this study suggested that providing review videos allowed students to practice and master content on their own, strengthening their autonomous study skills. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","autonomous learning skills; deaf and hard of hearing; STEM; YouTube","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085028299"

The majority of higher education institutions provides simple technical support to academic advisers with basic descriptive statistics. This article presents the general design and implementation of a Learning Analytics Dashboard for Advisers (LADA), to support the decision-making process of academic advisers through comparative and predictive analysis. Moreover, this work evaluates the use of this tool to support decision-making of actual advisers in two different higher education institutions (University A, University B), compared with more traditional procedures and tools. Results indicate that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases with students that failed many courses (MedianA=3,MedianB=2.5), in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions in a similar amount of time compared to the experts. These results are encouraging for further developments in the field. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Academic adviser; Academic advising; Data-driven decision-making; Learning analytics; Visualization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058469687"

We humans are in a time of cataclysmic change that rivals fire, the wheel, and the printing press. This change, the digitization of data, allows the collection of vast troves of data that allows healthcare system consolidation, more and more physician oversight, and the subsequent demand for business-like efficiency in the healthcare space. Dramatic changes like this creates collateral damage and can be frustrating for those that live through it. If the APDS is doing its job, we should be able to help Program Directors with these frustrations. The purposes of the APDS since its inception in 1977 is to: provide a forum for the exchange of information related to postgraduate surgical education; maintain high standards of surgical residency training; provide advice, assistance, and support to program directors; encourage research into all aspects of the education and training of surgeons; and represent the interests of program to other organizations. As we look to the future, I think 2 of these purposes should be paramount—research and advocacy. Research and advocacy are the cornerstones of EQIP. Research and advocacy can be linked by one word—truth. We need to seek the truth. We seek truth by collecting and analyzing data. We cannot hide from it, no matter where it leads us. We cannot shy away from the complexity of the search for truth no matter how difficult the process may be. EQIP is a continuous learning quality improvement program run by program directors for program directors to allow for data-driven innovation in surgical education and to allow data-informed conversations about the future of general surgery. EQIP will have a data gathering interface, a data repository and will have data analytics capability and data reporting platform. We are about to begin a 2-year proof of concept journey. So, in this time of great change and momentous challenge why should the APDS answer the bell? We should answer the bell for 4 reasons. We should answer the bell because engagement is a tool of resiliency, engagement solves frustration, and engagement is an antidote to burn-out. We should answer the bell because it gives us a chance to dramatically improve surgical education. We should answer the bell because we are in a great position to do this heavy lift. We should answer the bell because engagement is fun. © 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","advocacy; continuous learning quality improvement program; educational quality improvement project","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095728367"

Concerning its role in education, it is used to boost students' learning process by predicting their performance in advance and adapting the relevant instructional design strategies. This study primarily intends to develop a system that can predict students' performance and help teachers to timely introduce corrective interventions to uplift the performance of low-performing students. As a secondary part of this research, it also explores the potential of collaborative learning as an intervention to act in combination with the prediction system to improve the performance of students. To support such changes, a visualization system is also developed to track and monitor the performance of students, groups, and overall class to help teachers in the regrouping of students concerning their performance. Several well-known machine learning models are applied to predict students performance. Results suggest that experimental groups performed better after treatment than before treatment. The students who took part in each class activity, prepared and submitted their tasks perform much better than other students. Overall, the study found that collaborative learning methods play a significant role to enhance the learning capability of the students.  © 2013 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; Data analytics; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Learning management system; Machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121812730"

The field of learning analytics (LA) has made important contributions to the realisation of the first condition, especially in the context of blended learning and online learning. Prediction models that use data from institutional information systems and logs of learning management systems have gained a good reputation in predicting underperformance and dropout risk. However, less progress is made in resolving the second condition: applying LA generated feedback to design educational interventions. In our contribution, we make a plea for applying dispositional learning analytics (DLA) to make LA precise and actionable. DLA combines learning data, as in LA, with learners’ disposition data measured through self-report surveys. The advantage of DLA is twofold: first, it improves the accuracy of prediction, specifically early in the module, when limited LMS trace data are available. Second, the main benefit of DLA is in the design of effective interventions: interventions that focus on addressing individual learning dispositions that are less developed but important for being successful in the module. We provide an empirical analysis of DLA in an introductory mathematics module, demonstrating the important role that a broad range of learning dispositions can play in realising precision education. © 2021, Educational Technology and Society.

The purpose of this paper is to highlight dual perspectives within the learning analytics (LA) system in one institution: that of an administrator responsible for college-wide improvement, and a faculty member responsible for programmatic improvement. Design/methodology/approach: This manuscript provides a critical perspective with dual sets of experiences and viewpoints. This approach allows close examination of each perspective within the context of the existing literature, as the authors examine transitions in the use of LA. Findings: These viewpoints offer insight into the interpretation of LA through the lens of various roles. In examining these viewpoints, the authors offer three actionable steps for other institutions who seek to implement. Practical implications: These actionable steps offer a starting point for other institutions to engage in conversations related to the adoption of LA for continuous improvement across levels and roles. Relevant implications for various parties are discussed, with an emphasis on how administrators within the university system may support faculty to incorporate LA as part of their scholarly and teaching responsibilities. Originality/value: Few studies have examined the perspectives of multiple stakeholders within an institution. Here the authors have presented these dual perspectives in order to further the dialogue between university administration and faculty as analytic systems become more widespread. Through this dialogue, the authors see increased opportunities for all stakeholders to better understand their role in LA. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Higher education; Learning analytics; Learning management systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070279624"

Learning how to program not only enables learners to develop computing applications, but it can also enhance learners’ computational thinking (CT) practice. CT refers to learners’ ability to approach ill-structured tasks systematically based on algorithmic thinking in computing. Along with growing academic interests towards CT in recent studies, researchers have emphasized the role of teaching programming in facilitating learners’ problem-solving skills. Emerging OERs have expanded learners’ opportunities to engage in hands-on programming exercises; yet a challenge still remains as to how learners’ programming exercises can be tailored to accommodate individual differences in terms of learners’ digital literacy skills. There is still a lack of in-depth discussions on how to support learners’ personalized learning experiences during programming exercises associated with CT. This study hence proposes a conceptual framework that seeks to consider how to promotelearners’ personalized learning experiences and enhance their CT skills in OERs.

One of the key reported benefits is the capacity to keep students deeply engaged during their learning process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop models that can measure quantitatively how learners are engaging with learning games to inform game designers and educators, and to find ways to maximize learner engagement. In this article, we present our proposal to multidimensionally measure engagement in a learning game over four dimensions: general activity, social, exploration, and quests. We apply metrics from these dimensions to data from The Radix Endeavor, an inquiry-based online game for STEM learning that has been tested in K-12 classrooms as part of a pilot study across numerous schools. Based on these dimensions, we apply clustering and report four different engagement profiles that we define as 'integrally engaged,' 'lone achiever,' 'social explorer,' and 'nonengaged.' We also use three variables (account type, class grade, and gender) to perform a cross-sectional analysis finding interesting, statistically significant differences in engagement. For example, in-school students and accounts registered to males engaged socially much more than out-of-school learners or accounts registered to females, and that older students have better performance metrics than younger ones. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Engagement; game-based assessment; K-12 education; learning analytics; learning games","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078462522"

Institutions rarely inform their students about LA practices, and there exist significant privacy concerns. Without a clear student voice in the design of LA, institutions put themselves in an ethical gray area. To help fill this gap in practice and add to the growing literature on students' privacy perspectives, this study reports findings from over 100 interviews with undergraduate students at eight U.S. higher education institutions. Findings demonstrate that students lacked awareness of educational data-mining and analytic practices, as well as the data on which they rely. Students see potential in LA, but they presented nuanced arguments about when and with whom data should be shared; they also expressed why informed consent was valuable and necessary. The study uncovered perspectives on institutional trust that were heretofore unknown, as well as what actions might violate that trust. Institutions must balance their desire to implement LA with their obligation to educate students about their analytic practices and treat them as partners in the design of analytic strategies reliant on student data in order to protect their intellectual privacy. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082967132"

Educators, program coordinators and professors are interested in understanding how students are learning specific topics, how specific topics may influence the learning of other topics, how students’ grades/attendances in each course may represent important indicators to measure their performance, among other tasks. The use of data visualization and analytics is expanding in education institutions to perform a variety of tasks related to data processing and gaining into data-informed insights. In this paper, we present a visual analytic tool that combines data visualization and machine learning techniques to perform some visual analysis of students’ data from program courses. Two educational data collections were used to guide the creation of i) predictive models employing a variety of well known machine learning strategies, attempting to predict students’ future grade based on grade and attendance previous semesters and ii) a set interactive layouts that highlight the relationship between grades and attendance, also including additional variables such as gender, parents education level, among others. We performed several experiments, also using these data collections, to evaluate the layouts ability of highlighting interesting patterns, and we obtained promising results, demonstrating that such analysis may help the education experts to understand deficiencies on course structures. © 2019, The Author(s).","Education; Information visualization; Machine learning; Multidimensional data; Statistical test","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084062013"

In this paper, we outline the implementation of an assessment approach for a 10-day high school biology unit with computational thinking activities that examines student pre-post responses as well as responses to embedded assessments throughout the unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group’s CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit.

Existing approaches to model selection generally focus on optimizing the learning algorithm and associated hyperparameters. However, in real-world engineering applications, the parameters that are external to the learning algorithm, such as feature engineering, can also have a significant impact on the performance of the model. These external parameters do not fit into most existing approaches for model selection and are therefore often studied ad hoc or not at all. In this article, we develop a statistical design of experiment (DOEs) approach to model selection based on the use of the Taguchi method. The key idea is that we use orthogonal arrays to plan a set of build-and-test experiments to study the external parameters in combination with the learning algorithm. The use of orthogonal arrays maximizes the information learned from each experiment and, therefore, enables the experimental space to be explored extremely efficiently in comparison with grid or random search methods. We demonstrated the application of the statistical DOE approach to a real-world model selection problem involving predicting service request escalation. Statistical DOE significantly reduced the number of experiments necessary to fully explore the external parameters for this problem and was able to successfully optimize the model with respect to the objective function of minimizing total cost in addition to the standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, f-measure, and g-mean. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Automatically inferring the states or needs of learners from their posts is of interest to instructors, who are faced with a high attrition in MOOCs. Machine learning has previously been successfully used to identify states such as confusion or posting questions, but no solution has yet been provided so that instructors can track the progress of the learners using a validated framework from education research. In this paper, we develop a model to automatically label a post based on the first phase of the interaction analysis model (IAM). This allows instructors to automatically identify whether students are stating opinions, clarifying details, or engaging in activities such as providing examples to peers. Our model is tested on a Coursera MOOC devoted to Chemistry, for which we are able to correctly categorize the IAM status in 4 out of 5 posts. Our approach thus provides instructors with an intelligent system that generates actionable learning assessment data and can cope with large enrollment. Using the system, instructors can quickly identify and remedy learning issues, thus supporting learners in attaining their intended outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Computer supported collaborative learning; Learning analytics; Massive open online courses; Supervised learning; Text mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080932764"

More specifically, CPS serves as a pertinent showcase for addressing a crucial existing gap contemporary education is facing, the gap between students' ability to acquire and subsequently apply knowledge in uncertain situations, which are increasingly important in the 21st century. While the CPS process incorporates both the acquisition and application of knowledge, many earlier studies have focused on identifying the factors relevant for success in knowledge acquisition. Given the dearth of existing research on factors influencing a successful transition between both CPS phases, we investigated the rates of successful and unsuccessful knowledge transition over the course of nine CPS items in a sample of N = 1151 students in 9th grade. Results showed that many participants were unable to transition their knowledge from the acquisition to the application phase, which was presumably due to an inefficient mental model transfer. Furthermore, the likelihood of students being ‘lost in transition’ was higher in more complex items.

Most of the predictive analytic applications in higher education are proprietary, with private companies offering little transparency about their underlying models. We address this lack of transparency by systematically comparing two important dimensions: (1) different approaches to sample and variable construction and how these affect model accuracy and (2) how the selection of predictive modeling approaches, ranging from methods many institutional researchers would be familiar with to more complex machine learning methods, affects model performance and the stability of predicted scores. The relative ranking of students’ predicted probability of completing college varies substantially across modeling approaches. While we observe substantial gains in performance from models trained on a sample structured to represent the typical enrollment spells of students and with a robust set of predictors, we observe similar performance between the simplest and the most complex models. © The Author(s) 2021.","college success; community colleges; data science; predictive analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112477967"

Milestones should enable the learner and training program to know an individual’s competency development trajectory. Background: Milestone Level ratings for residents grouped by specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine) show that, in aggregate, senior residents receive higher ratings than junior residents. Anesthesiology Milestones, as assessed by both residents and faculty, also have a positive linear relationship with postgraduate year. However, these studies have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal cohort studies, and studies of how individual residents progress during the course of training are needed. Longitudinal data analysis of performance assessment trajectories addresses a relevant validity question for the Next Accreditation System. We explored the application of learning analytics to longitudinal Milestones data to: 1) measure the frequency of “straight-lining”; 2) assess the proportion of residents that reach “Level 4” (ready for unsupervised practice) by graduation for each subcompetency; 3) identify variability among programs and individual residents in their baseline Milestone Level and rates of improvement; and 4) determine how hypothetically constructed growth curve models fit to the Milestones data reported to ACGME. Approach: De-identified Milestone Level ratings in each of the 25 subcompetencies submitted semiannually to the ACGME from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017 were retrospectively analyzed for graduating residents (n = 67) from a convenience sample of five anesthesia residency programs. The data reflected longitudinal resident Milestone progression from the beginning of the first year to the end of the third and final year of clinical anesthesiology training. The frequency of straight-lining, defined as the resident receiving the same exact Milestone Level rating for all 25 subcompetencies on a given 6-month report, was calculated for each program. Every resident was evaluated six times during training with the possibility of six straight-lined ratings. Findings: The number of residents in each program ranged from 5-21 (Median 13, range 16). Mean Milestone Level ratings for subcompetencies were significantly different at each six-month assessment (p < 0.001). Frequency of straight-lining varied significantly by program from 9% − 57% (Median 22%). Depending on the program, 53%-100% (median 86%) of residents reached the graduation target Level 4 or higher in all 25 anesthesiology subcompetencies. Nine to 18% of residents did not achieve a Level 4 rating for at least one subcompetency at any time during their residency. Across programs, significant variability was found in first-year clinical anesthesia training Milestone Levels, as well in the rate of improvement for five of the six core competencies. Conclusions: Anesthesia residents’ Milestone Level growth trajectories as reported to the ACGME vary significantly across individual residents as well as by program. The present study offers a case example that raises concerns regarding the validity of the Next Accreditation System as it is currently used by some residency programs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","growth curve; Learning trajectories; milestones","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097613392"

With the rise of data and analytics, there is an opportunity for cross-disciplinary teaching by integrating technology throughout the business curriculum. However, many business professors have little experience in cross-disciplinary teaching. We hope to rectify this by introducing an approach that uses prelecture material to prepare students for learning concepts and terms that are not core to the focal class. In a study that combines Structured Query Language (SQL) coding with an audit principle called Benford's Law, we analyze the impact of adding prelecture material about Benford's Law on student's cognitive load, knowledge gained, and instructional efficiency. Results indicate that students who received a prelecture on Benford's Law outperformed the control group in performance measures related to Benford's Law, and that the instructional efficiency on Benford's Law was also higher for the treatment group. We did not find any significant differences in cognitive load between the two groups, nor did the treatment group perform significantly better when tested on the SQL concepts. We conclude that cross-discipline teaching is a fine balance between each discipline and communicating to students the importance of both disciplines is key. © 2020 Decision Sciences Institute","Accounting Fraud; Benford's Law; Cognitive Load Theory; Element Interactivity; Instructional Efficiency; Relational Database; SQL; Structured Query Language; Transient Information Effect","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084447644"

It is based on the notion of repeatability of activities defining skill. The analysis is based on two subsequent classification steps that analyze (1) movements or activities and (2) their qualities, that is, the actual skills of a human performing them. The first classifier is trained in either a supervised or unsupervised manner and provides confidence scores, which are then used for assessing skills. We evaluate the proposed method in two scenarios: gymnastics and surgical skill training of medical students.

To address these questions, we analyze multimodal data collected from 25 9–11-year-old dyads using a fractions intelligent tutoring system.

Our main results, computed by applying learning analytics on the trace data results, suggest that students playing solo had higher in-game engagement and solved more puzzles, while students collaborating were less linear in their pathways, skipping more tutorial levels and were more exploratory with Shadowspect features.

Leveraging learning analytics to capture and analyze student practices in simulated or game-based authentic science activities is a potential avenue for assessing EBAS. Our previous work characterized inquiry practices of experts and novices engaged in simulated authentic science inquiry and suggested that practices may reflect EBAS. Here, we extend our prior qualitative work to quantitatively examine differences in practices and EBAS between non-science majors, biology majors, and bi-ology graduates. We observed that inquiry practices of non-science majors and biology graduates were similar to the novice and expert practices, respectively, in our prior work. However, biology majors sometimes appeared to act like their undergraduate peers (e.g., performing fewer planning actions) but other times were more similar to biology grad-uates (e.g., performing complex investigations). We noted that cognitive constructs like metacognition were also important for understanding which practices were most likely to be reflective of EBAS. This work advances how to assess EBAS using learning analytics and raises questions regarding the development of cognitive processes like EBAS among aspiring biologists. © 2020 M. E.

Advanced automation, sensors, materials and data analytics will increase the need for highly skilled workers in the manufacturing (and manufactured construction) sector. Attracting and developing the next-generation workforce is not without its challenges; however, students are often deficient in technical skills and generally have negative perceptions about manufacturing and construction. As a result, new education and training models have been developed to provide instruction at all levels of the educational system, with a focus on both traditional students and non-traditional students, including ethnic minorities, women, veterans, disabled persons and older adult learners. This study focused specifically on certain underrepresented students in STEM programs offered at community colleges in the Great Plains region of the U.S. An available online training program by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers was used as a contextualized online training tool. The Learning Management System embedded in this online training tool was used to gather student data. Conducting multiple regression analyses on the test outcomes, completion rates, and improvement between post-test and pre-test scores showed that female participants achieved greater improvement between pre- and post-test scores than males, and achieved higher rates of credentialing compared to all other demographic groups. African American participants achieved greatest improvement between pre- and post-test scores than all other ethnic groups while Hispanics achieved higher rates of module completion. Additionally, this study also examines the background related to contextualized teaching and learning, as well as the effectiveness of this delivery method for these underrepresented populations. © 2020 by the authors.

The factory operations face challenges of highly nonlinear and stochastic activity due to the countless uncertainties and interdependencies that exist. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), especially Machine Learning (ML) have shown great potential to transform the manufacturing domain through advanced analytics tools for processing the vast amounts of manufacturing data generated, known as Big Data. The focus of this paper is threefold: (1) review the state-of-the-art applications of AI to representative manufacturing problems, (2) provide a systematic view for analyzing data and process dependencies at multiple levels that AI must comprehend, and (3) identify challenges and opportunities to not only further leverage AI for manufacturing, but also influence the future development of AI to better meet the needs of manufacturing. To satisfy these objectives, the paper adopts the hierarchical organization widely practiced in manufacturing plants in examining the interdependencies from the overall system level to the more detailed granular level of incoming material process streams. In doing so, the paper considers a wide range of topics from throughput and quality, supervisory control in human-robotic collaboration, process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis, finally to advances in materials engineering to achieve desired material property in process modeling and control.  © 2021 by ASME.","Computer-integrated manufacturing; control and automation; modeling and simulation; monitoring and diagnostics; plant engineering and maintenance; process planning; production systems optimization; sensing; sensors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098528000"

Informed consent is one mechanism by which to accomplish these goals, but Big Data practices challenge the efficacy of this strategy. To ensure the usefulness of informed consent, I argue for the development of Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) technology and assert that privacy dashboards will enable student control and consent mechanisms, while providing an opportunity for institutions to justify their practices according to existing norms and values. © 2019, The Author(s).","Autonomy; Higher education; Informed consent; Learning analytics; Student privacy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068625122"

However, further adoption of centralized machine learning in industries seems to be restricted due to data privacy issues. Federated learning has the potential to bring about predictive features in industrial systems without leaking private information. However, its implementation involves key challenges including resource optimization, robustness, and security. In this article, we propose a novel dispersed federated learning (DFL) framework to provide resource optimization, whereby distributed fashion of learning offers robustness. We formulate an integer linear optimization problem to minimize the overall federated learning cost for the DFL framework. To solve the formulated problem, first, we decompose it into two sub-problems: association and resource allocation problem. Second, we relax the association and resource allocation sub-problems to make them convex optimization problems. Later, we use the rounding technique to obtain binary association and resource allocation variables. Our proposed algorithm works in an iterative manner by fixing one problem variable (for example, association) and compute the other (for example, resource allocation). The iterative algorithm continues until convergence of the formulated cost optimization problem. Furthermore, we compare the proposed DFL with two schemes; namely, random resource allocation and random association. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed DFL scheme. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

By collecting think-aloud verbal reports, the current study was designed to investigate differences in specific thought processes between medical students (novices) as they learn and radiologists (experts), so that we can better design future instructional environments. Seven medical students and four physicians with radiology training were asked to interpret and diagnose pediatric elbow radiographs where fracture is suspected. After reporting their diagnosis of a case, they were given immediate feedback. Participants were asked to verbalize their thoughts while completing the diagnosis and while they reflected on the provided feedback. The protocol analysis of their verbalizations showed that participants used some combination of four processes to interpret the case: gestalt interpretation, purposeful search, rule application, and reasoning from a prior case. All types of processes except reasoning from a prior case were applied significantly more frequently by experts. Further, gestalt interpretation was used with higher frequency in abnormal cases while purposeful search was used more often for normal cases.

On the other hand, long-term motivation indicates a sort of continuing commitment that is required to complete assigned task. As short-term motivational problems span for a limited period of time, such as a session, therefore, they need to be addressed in real time to keep the learner engaged in the learning process. Similarly, long-term learners’ motivation plays an equally important role to retain the learner in the long run and minimize the risk of dropout. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to incorporate a comprehensive learner motivation model that is based on short-term and long-term aspects of the learners' motivation. This approach enables Web-based educational systems to identify the real-time motivational state of the learner and provide personalized interventions to keep the learners engaged in learning process. Design/methodology/approach: Recent research regarding personalized Web-based educational systems demonstrates learner’s motivation to be an essential component of the learning model. This is because of the fact that low motivation results in either students’ less engagement or complete drop out from the learning activities. A learner motivation model is considered to be a set of perceptions and beliefs that the system has developed about a learner. This includes both short-term and long-term motivations of leaners. Findings: This study proposed a framework of a domain independent learners’ motivation model based on firm educational theories. The proposed framework consists of two modules. The primary module deals with real-time identification of motivation and logging off activities such as login, forum participation and adherence to assessment deadline. Secondary module maintains the profile of leaners associated with both short-term and long-term motivation. A study was conducted to verify the impact of learners’ motivation model and personalized interventional strategies based on proposed model, using Systematical Information Education Method assessment standards. The results show an increase in motivational index and the characteristics associated with motivation during the conducted study. Originality/value: Motivational diagnosis is important for both traditional classrooms and Web-based education systems. It is one of the major elements that contribute in the success of the learning process. However, dropout rate among online students is very high, which leads to incorporate motivational elements in more personalized way because motivated students will retain the course until they successfully complete it. Hence, identifying learner’s motivation, updating learners’ motivation model based on this identification and providing personalized interventions are the key for the success of Web-based educational systems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Adaptive system theory; E-learning; Higher education; Learning analytics; Learning management systems; Modelling; Motivation model; Real-time learner modeling; Web-based education systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113734061"

Difficulties in an introductory programming class often snowball, resulting in poor student performance or dropping the major completely. In this paper, we present an analysis of 197 students over 6 semesters from 11 sections of an introductory programming class at a private four-year liberal arts university in the southeastern United States. The goal of this research was to find the earliest point in the assessment sequence which could predict final grade outcomes. Accordingly, we measured the degree of correlation between student performance on quizzes, labs, programs, and tests compared to final course grade. Overall, the results show a strong positive correlation for all four assessment modalities. These results hold significance for educators and researchers insofar as the body of computing education research is extended by evaluating the relative effectiveness of early semester subsets of each of the four categories of student data to model class outcomes. © 2021, North American Business Press.

This game uses a myriad of pedagogical features including multiple-choice tests, adaptive natural language tutorial conversations, case-based reasoning, and an E-text to engage students. The game teaches 11 topics in research methodology across three distinct modules that target factual information, application of reasoning to specific cases, and question generation. The goal of this investigation is to discover predictors of deep and shallow learning by blending Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) with educational data mining. In line with ECD, time-honored cognitive processes or behaviors of time-on-task, discrimination, generation, and scaffolding were selected because there is a large research history supporting their importance to learning. The study included 192 college students who participated in a pretest-interaction-posttest design. These data were used to discover the best predictors of learning across the training experiences. Results revealed distinctly different patterns of predictors of deep versus shallow learning for students across the training environments of the game. Specifically, more interactivity is important for environments contributing to shallow learning whereas generation and discrimination is more important in training environments supporting deeper learning. However, in some training environments the positive impact of generation may be at the price of decreased discrimination. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Educational data mining; Educational game; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071431599"

The current study examines the relationship between information indirectly presented through academic advisors' use of LADs, and college students' academic motivation, self-regulated learning, and academic achievement. We modeled how changes in student motivation and self-regulated learning (SRL) were related to what occurred during 1-on-1 meetings with academic advisors during which students had the potential to view representations of their achievement embedded within an Early Warning System (EWS) that visually represented aspects of their academic performance referenced with course averages. Constructs associated with SRL were moderated by advisor-advisee meetings. Results indicated that advisors' use of EWS while they met with students was negatively associated with the rate of decrease of students' reporting of using memorizing strategies but positively related when students' performance was compared to that of their peers. We discuss the moderating effects of students’ exposure to visualizations of academic performance on their SRL strategies and academic motivation. This study points to the importance of monitoring the effects of information presented via EWS on motivation and SRL. © 2020","Dashboards; Higher education; Learning analytics; Motivation; Self-regulated learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097351612"

However, few studies attempt to understand how instructors interact with an LA dashboard and how self-regulated learning (SRL) activities and emotions of instructors occur and co-occur in the interaction. The current study investigates ten instructors’ SRL activities and epistemic emotions by analyzing the screen capture videos and think-aloud data while they interact with an LA dashboard designed to support the online asynchronous collaboration of multiple groups. The results reveal that instructors demonstrated two ways of navigating LA dashboards, and they relied heavily on the conversation explorer feature. Instructors were mostly engaged in elaboration, monitoring, and evaluation activities and they frequently experienced confusion and enjoyment. Expert instructors were more likely to refer to their personal teaching experience and demonstrated more epistemic emotions than novice instructors. This study contributes to the literature on SRL and teacher emotions by revealing the critical role of elaboration, monitoring, evaluation, and epistemic emotions when instructors attempt to understand a LA dashboard by themselves. These findings highlight the importance of providing pedagogical assistance to teachers who are trying to navigate between group dynamics and visualizations viewed using LA dashboards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asynchronous online collaborative learning; Emotions; Learning analytics dashboard; Self-regulated learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094907180"

The purpose of this study is to describe how school leaders and researchers visualized and jointly made sense of data from a common learning management system (LMS) used by students across multiple schools and grades in a charter management organization operating in the USA. To make sense of LMS data, researchers and practitioners formed a partnership to organize complex data sets, create data visualizations and engage in joint sensemaking around data visualizations to begin to launch continuous improvement cycles. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyzed LMS data for n = 476 students in Algebra I using hierarchical cluster analysis heatmaps. The authors also engaged in a qualitative case study that examined the ways in which school leaders made sense of the data visualization to inform improvement efforts. Findings: The outcome of this study is a framework for informing evidence-based improvement cycles using large, complex data sets. Central to moving through the various steps in the proposed framework are collaborations between researchers and practitioners who each bring expertise that is necessary for organizing, filtering and visualizing data from digital learning environments and administrative data systems.

Investigations into the use of these systems have considered how well students learn when certain approaches are employed. However, we do not fully understand how course type or system design influence student actions and experiences, meaning prior findings cannot be properly interpreted and used because we do not understand how these factors influence those findings. Accordingly, we conducted a study to compare student experiences and behaviors across learning management systems and courses from a learning analytics perspective. Differences in student behaviors and experiences highlight how system design and the nature of the course interact: Students reported increased learning support when using a system that foregrounds student interaction through discussion forums, but this relationship did not hold across all course types. Similarly, students from the content-delivery focused system spent more time online while feeling less supported regardless of which type of course they were taking. This newly found evidence for the often-interrelated influence that the course and system have on student experiences and behaviors should therefore be considered when selecting a system to meet particular pedagogical goals. © 2020, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","Cooperative/collaborative learning; Evaluation of CAL systems; Human-computer interface; Learning communities; Post-secondary education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090785420"

In tandem, the impetus to derive meaningful insights from data gains urgency. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in the area of voice and image recognition and so-called complete knowledge games like chess, go, and StarCraft, have resulted in a flurry of research. Using two educational datasets, we explore the utility and applicability of deep learning for educational data mining and learning analytics. We compare the predictive accuracy of popular deep learning frameworks/libraries, including, Keras, Theano, Tensorflow, fast.ai, and Pytorch. Experimental results reveal that performance, as assessed by predictive accuracy, varies depending on the optimizer used. Further, findings from additional experiments by tuning network parameters yield similar results. Moreover, we find that deep learning displays comparable performance to other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression. We argue that statistical learning techniques should be selected to maximize interpretability and should contribute to our understanding of educational and learning phenomena; hence, in most cases, educational data mining and learning analytics researchers should aim for explanation over prediction. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Deep learning; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; Machine learning; Predictive analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075862770"

The response is from a K-12 educational environment perspective. Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s typology of different ethical approaches to learning analytics adds value to the special issue topic of shifting to digital as it provides different ways to view learning analytics as well as the type of approval(s) possibly needed for each view. K-12 educational institutions can utilize the manuscript as a starting place for review of their ethical oversights when analyzing student data as more schools are shifting to digital. A limitation of Willis, Slade, and Prinsloo’s manuscript in supporting the shift to digital is that the manuscript was published before the overwhelming shift to digital was mandated as a result of Covid-19. Future work related to the manuscript and with a focus on the K-12 educational environment could include K-12 education agencies deriving a K-12 specific typology from a review of ethical oversight protocols or analyzing the effects of the shift to digital in K-12 on the original typology. During the 2020 pandemic, K-12 schools in the United States moved to digital learning quickly and in large numbers.

The MOOC data not only contains learner profiles and learning outcomes, but also sequential information about when and which type of learning activities each learner performs, such as reviewing a lecture video before undertaking an assignment. Learning sequence analytics could help understand the correlations between learning sequences and performances, which further characterize different learner groups. However, few works have explored the sequence of learning activities, which have mostly been considered aggregated events. A visual analytics system called ViSeq is introduced to resolve the loss of sequential information, to visualize the learning sequence of different learner groups, and to help better understand the reasons behind the learning behaviors. The system facilitates users in exploring learning sequences from multiple levels of granularity. ViSeq incorporates four linked views: the projection view to identify learner groups, the pattern view to exhibit overall sequential patterns within a selected group, the sequence view to illustrate the transitions between consecutive events, and the individual view with an augmented sequence chain to compare selected personal learning sequences.

While students appreciate the option of participating either face-to-face (F2F) or remotely (RMT), questions remain whether RMT students are as engaged and learning at the same rate as students participating F2F. A survey course on extreme weather has been offered in a blended synchronous format for multiple semesters. The course was live-streamed, and students could freely decide whether to attend F2F or RMT on a class-by-class basis. Technology allowed all students to answer formative assessment questions and ask questions during class sessions. The pros for offering the blended synchronous environment were found to be: 1) it was very popular with students and 2) the rate of attendance (∼85% daily) was considered significantly higher than the daily attendance rates in previous semesters. The cons for the blended synchronous environment were that students choosing the remote mode of participation did not appear to be as attentive and their exam grades were lower. More troubling, it appears that students who had lower incoming grade point averages (iGPA) tended to prefer participating remotely, which may represent that these students used the option to avoid a deeper commitment to engagement. Significantly, it was also found that students with lower iGPA who chose to participate in class activities at a higher frequency and choosing to more frequently attend class physically, received grades similar to higher iGPA students.While blended learning increases options for student participation it will be important to monitor how its availability affects student participation and learning and especially those students who have been previously less successful academically. © 2020 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","blended learning; blended synchronous course; Blended synchronous learning; learning analytics; student engagement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086871579"

Cunningham (1991) noted that collaborating learners bring, discuss and debate multiple perspectives to develop their own position while acknowledging others' views. Higher levels of knowledge construction emerged when posts stimulated frequent reply by multiple participants (Aviv, Erlich, Ravid, & Geva, 2003) and were strongly content- and task-oriented (Rovai, 2007). So, to help students more actively and productively engage in knowledge-constructing discussions, an instructor needs to detect students' posts that do not stimulate replies, identify content those posts introduce, and guide students to revise posts to encourage peers' responses. However, such monitoring would be very time- and energy-consuming, especially in large-enrolment courses (Hura, 2010). To set a stage for developing a classifier to automate these tasks, we proposed 10 rhetorical moves characteristic of the interactive mode of Chi and Wylie's ICAP framework (2014) and categorized fine-grained content in discussion posts using these moves. We then identified attributes of posts that triggered a greater number of responses. Rhetorical moves of “asking questions,” “requesting justification,” “building-on,” “giving a reason” and “making a claim” triggered more peer responses. Posts with moves of “disagreeing,” “comparing” and “making claims” predicted students' achievement on a test and an argumentative writing task. We propose analytics for learners and instructors about forming and revising posts to promote constructive discussions and subsequent achievements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cooperative/collaborative learning; Distance education and online learning; Post-secondary education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088132744"

However, it is often challenging for beginners to take their first step due to the complexity of understanding and applying deep learning. We present CNN Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn and examine convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a foundational deep learning model architecture. Our tool addresses key challenges that novices face while learning about CNNs, which we identify from interviews with instructors and a survey with past students. CNN Explainer tightly integrates a model overview that summarizes a CNN's structure, and on-demand, dynamic visual explanation views that help users understand the underlying components of CNNs. Through smooth transitions across levels of abstraction, our tool enables users to inspect the interplay between low-level mathematical operations and high-level model structures. A qualitative user study shows that CNN Explainer helps users more easily understand the inner workings of CNNs, and is engaging and enjoyable to use. We also derive design lessons from our study. Developed using modern web technologies, CNN Explainer runs locally in users' web browsers without the need for installation or specialized hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern deep learning techniques. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; machine learning; visual analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098762597"

A large body of academic studies has attempted to identify and explain the potential causes and consequences of corruption, at varying levels of granularity, mostly through theoretical lenses by using correlations and regression-based statistical analyses. The present study approaches the phenomenon from the predictive analytics perspective by employing contemporary machine learning techniques to discover the most important corruption perception predictors based on enriched/enhanced nonlinear models with a high level of predictive accuracy. Specifically, within the multiclass classification modeling setting that is employed herein, the Random Forest (an ensemble-type machine learning algorithm) is found to be the most accurate prediction/classification model, followed by Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. From the practical standpoint, the enhanced predictive power of machine learning algorithms coupled with a multi-source database revealed the most relevant corruption-related information, contributing to the related body of knowledge, generating actionable insights for administrator, scholars, citizens, and politicians. The variable importance results indicated that government integrity, property rights, judicial effectiveness, and education index are the most influential factors in defining the corruption level of significance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Corruption perception; Government integrity; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Random forest; Social development; Society policies and regulations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073157082"

The boundaries between what we know, how we know it and the ways we assess and evaluate knowledge in formal and informal settings are now blurred [1], [2]. In these environments, students often interact with one another to produce and reproduce knowledge and transfer it into a new context to reach a mastery level of learning [3]. The massive amount of data being generated by learners makes it easier to assess performance than ever before [4], [5]. Every learner action is logged and factored in as a source of evidence to contribute to the overall learner assessment both from a summative perspective, and also in a formative way where immediate feedback is actionable. The integration of learning analytics tools and machine learning techniques can facilitate the process of assessment. In this paper we present a case study to show how the integration of learning analytics benefited learners and improved their performance in an online educational course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, while also holding them accountable for their own learning.

The goal of accelerated instructions is to offer students the advantage of completing classes in a shorter time span. Current research focused on comparing different instructional lengths, reporting mixed findings. Online accelerated instructions are not necessarily superior or inferior to traditional 16-week instructions. Research should focus on the preparation of students on how to succeed in accelerated online courses. This study examines how self-regulated learning skills may serve as predictors to successful learning experiences through online accelerated instructions. It concludes that all six self-regulated learning skills can predict online accelerated learning experience success and suggested that educators should identify and prepare students with relevant self-regulated learning skills prior to the accelerated instructions to prepare for positive learning.

However, few have considered the impact of time on these learning-related dimensions, partly due to reliance on self-reported instruments that are not sufficient to measure the temporal, changeable, and iterative relationships among learning-related dimensions during online conversation. The purpose of the current study was to use learning analytics to investigate longitudinally the relationships among learning-related emotions, learner participation level, and cognitive effort of students. Analysis of system-stored student data from 56 students enrolled in a wiki-based, blended undergraduate writing course revealed that positive or negative expressed emotions led to higher participation in ongoing discussions and that participation level predicted the rate of change in textual revision. These findings not only confirm theories of learner engagement but also demonstrate the viability of trace data and their potential in educational research and practice. © 2020, Beijing Normal University.","Asynchronous online discussion; Expressed emotion; Learner participation; Learning analytics; Longitudinal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088827070"

Recent advances in IoT hardware, e.g., networks of heterogeneous embedded devices, and software, e.g., lightweight computer vision algorithms and cloud optimization solutions, make it possible to efficiently process data from diverse sources in a connected (smart) farm. By interconnecting these IoT devices, often across large geographical distances, it is possible to collect data at different time scales, including in near real-time (i.e., with delays of only a few tens of seconds). This data can then be used for actionable insights, e.g., precise applications of soil supplements and reduced environmental footprint. Through LATTICE, we present an integrated vision for IoT solutions, data processing, and actionable analytics for digital agriculture. We couple this with discussion of economics and policy considerations that will underlie adoption of such IoT and ML technologies. Our paper starts off with the types of datasets in typical field operations, followed by the lifecycle for the data and storage, cloud and edge analytics, and fast information-retrieval solutions. We discuss what algorithms are proving to be most impactful in this space, e.g., approximate data analytics and on-device/in-network processing. We conclude by discussing analytics for alternative agriculture for generation of biofuels and policy challenges in the implementation of digital agriculture in the wild.  © 2020 IEEE.","cloud computing; data analysis; Data integration; internet of things; Sensor systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119298869"

Done under the banner of “learning analytics,” this work can—and often does—surface sensitive data and information about, inter alia, a student's demographics, academic performance, offline and online movements, physical fitness, mental wellbeing, and social network. With these data, institutions and third parties are able to describe student life, predict future behaviors, and intervene to address academic or other barriers to student success (however defined). Learning analytics, consequently, raise serious issues concerning student privacy, autonomy, and the appropriate flow of student data. We argue that issues around privacy lead to valid questions about the degree to which students should trust their institution to use learning analytics data and other artifacts (algorithms, predictive scores) with their interests in mind. We argue that higher education institutions are paradigms of information fiduciaries. As such, colleges and universities have a special responsibility to their students.

As reported by Grand View Research, Inc., the global market of DT is expected to reach $26.07 billion by 2025 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 38.2%. The growing adoption of cyber-physical system (CPS), Internet of Things, big data analytics, and cloud computing in manufacturing sector has paved the way for low cost and systematic implementation of DT, with promising impacts on (a) product design and development, (b) machine and equipment health monitoring, and (c) product support and services. Successful implementation of DT would increase transparency, cooperation, flexibility, resilience, production speed, scalability, and manufacturing efficiency. Realisation of smart manufacturing requires collaborative and autonomous interactions between sensing, networking, and computational resources across manufacturing assets where data is gathered from physical systems is utilised for the extraction of actionable insights and provision of predictive services.

We found that student participation dropped significantly in moving online, but instructors were able to implement new teaching strategies to increase participation. We document seven concrete strategies that instructors used to promote equitable participation in their online classes and that can be incorporated by biology ed-ucators into their online teaching. The strategies were: 1) re-establishing norms, 2) using student names, 3) using breakout rooms, 4) leveraging chat-based participation, 5) using polling software, 6) creating an inclusive curriculum, and 7) cutting content to maintain rigor.

While the former can be solved by instructional design, the latter is still open and may be solved by Social Learning Analytics (SLA). This paper proposes B-LABS (Blogs and Learning Analytics Based Seminar), a higher education seminar with a formal component as a face-to-face seminar, and an informal component comprising learning in OKCs. B-LABS was carried out with N = 65 undergraduate students. SLA tools were employed to select responsive OKCs that were likely to integrate newcomers. The students successfully followed the B-LABS script; learning outcomes included students’ insight in mathematics didactics, and knowledge of OKC specific educational approaches. Student acceptance of the learning environment was predicted by performance expectancy and perceived social influence.

Recent developments in sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and the ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) have increased the collection of data (including health care, social media, smart cities, agriculture, finance, education, and more) to an enormous scale. However, the data collected from sensors, social media, financial records, etc. is inherently uncertain due to noise, incompleteness, and inconsistency. The analysis of such massive amounts of data requires advanced analytical techniques for efficiently reviewing and/or predicting future courses of action with high precision and advanced decision-making strategies. As the amount, variety, and speed of data increases, so too does the uncertainty inherent within, leading to a lack of confidence in the resulting analytics process and decisions made thereof. In comparison to traditional data techniques and platforms, artificial intelligence techniques (including machine learning, natural language processing, and computational intelligence) provide more accurate, faster, and scalable results in big data analytics. Previous research and surveys conducted on big data analytics tend to focus on one or two techniques or specific application domains. However, little work has been done in the field of uncertainty when applied to big data analytics as well as in the artificial intelligence techniques applied to the datasets.

For the past 3 years, our institution has used The Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (O-SCORE) instrument to assess and track operative skills. Evaluation is accomplished in near real-time using a secure web-based platform for data management and analytics (Firefly). Simultaneous to access of the platform's case logging function, the O-SCORE instrument is delivered to faculty members for rapid completion, facilitating quality, and timeliness of feedback. We sought to demonstrate the platform's utility in detecting operative performance changes over time in response to focused educational interventions based on stored case log and O-SCORE data. DESIGN: Stored resident performance assessments for the most frequently performed laparoscopic procedures (cholecystectomy, appendectomy, inguinal hernia repair, ventral hernia repair) were examined for 3 successive academic years (2016-2019). During this time, 4 of 36 residents had received program-assigned supplemental simulation training to improve laparoscopic skills. O-SCORE data for these residents were extracted from peer data, which were used for comparisons. Assigned training consisted of a range of videoscopic and virtual reality skills drills with performance objectives. O-SCORE responses were converted to integers and autonomy scores for items pertaining to technical skill were compared before and after educational interventions (Student's t-tests). These scores were also compared to aggregate scores in the nonintervention group. Bayesian-modeled learning curves were used to characterize patterns of improvement over time. SETTING: University of Massachusetts Medical School-Baystate Surgery Residency and Baystate Medical Center PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents (n = 36) RESULTS: During the period of review, 3325 resident cases were identified meeting the case type criteria. As expected, overall autonomy increased with the number of cases performed. The 4 residents who had been assigned supplemental training (6-18 months) had preintervention score averages that were lower than that of the nonintervention group (2.25 ± 0.43 vs 3.57 ± 1.02; p < 0.0001). During the respective intervention periods, all 4 residents improved autonomy scores (increase to 3.40 ± 0.61; p < 0.0001). Similar improvements were observed for tissue handling, instrument handling, bimanual dexterity, visuospatial skill, and operative efficiency component skills. Postintervention scores were not significantly different compared to scores for the non-intervention group. Bayesian-modeled learning curves showed a similar pattern of postintervention performance improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The data management platform proved to be an effective tool to track responses to supplemental training that was deemed necessary to close defined skills gaps in laparoscopic surgery. This could be seen both in individual and in aggregated data. We were gratified that at the conclusion of the supplemental training, O-SCORE results for the intervention group were not different than those seen in the non-intervention group. © 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","Laparoscopic training; Medical Knowledge; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Procedural knowledge; Surgical autonomy; Surgical competency; Surgical education; Surgical simulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087030442"

He has served as Principal Investigator on grants funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Soros Foundation (to name but a few) and is the founding President of the Society for Learning Analytics Research. In this wide-ranging interview, George Siemens reconstructs his personal history as a lifelong learner and discusses his work, specifically on Connectivism, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and Learning Analytics. One of the leading thinkers in deepening our understanding on the impacts of technology on higher education and learning, George Siemens shares his personal experience of the utilitarian schooling system in his childhood which inspired him to have different perspectives on the interactions between education and technology, thus leading to his concept of Connectivism as well as his creation of MOOCs. He gives some insights on his seminal book, Knowing Knowledge, and elaborates on his perception of “knowledge” as well as the interactions of the four critical traits (diversity, autonomy, interactivity, and openness) in connective knowledge networks. Learning analytics is another focus for Siemens, and this relatively new, but quickly expanding, field can provide insights on the flow of information such as social activities, engagement patterns and a range of other factors that facilitate the quality of the learning experience for students. Siemens further emphasizes the cultural aspects of best practices of teaching and learning and also assessment in higher education. Siemens gives a preview of his future work which will focus on how human and artificial cognition may influence knowledge processes and their impacts on society. © Kaplan Singapore.

After basic statistical analysis (T-Student and correlations), we found that differences in grades related to type of students and type of class are more significant that those associated to online with in-class exams. Results are aligned with literature. In accordance with the results of this and previous studies, we do not expect significant higher level of cheating in online exams versus traditional in-class exams. We justify this based upon the reality, broadly reflected in the literature, that cheating is already quite present, before the coronavirus pandemic Many countries have 50%-85% of University students reporting cheating at least once. Cheating is not an specific online problem. Teaching online brings new challenges and opportunities. We recommend to re-evaluate pedagogical methods and engage more in continuous evaluations, relaying less in exams. Code of Conducts, the use of cheating detection algorithms, data analytics from the online Learning Management Systems for assessment and cheating checking programs available (Turnitin and others) to review online exams is recommended. We should help students understand the importance of learning over grades. Also faculty should online teaching faster be at the same level than students in technology and digital capabilities; the closer we are with our students the more effective we can assess them and, more important, we can contribute more and better to their learning and education. © 2021, Universidad Pablo de Olavide.

In this paper, we use an inhouse-developed IoT-enabled manufacturing testbed to study the characteristics of the big data generated from the testbed. Since the quality of the data usually has the most impact on process modeling, data veracity is often the most challenging characteristic of big data. To address that, we explore the role of feature engineering in developing effective machine learning models for predicting key process variables.

Meanwhile, problem-based learning is a teaching technique specifically designed to motivate students to learn efficiently, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively. With this aim, we developed a problem-based learning course for both undergraduate and graduate students to teach NLP. We provided student teams with big data sets, basic guidelines, cloud computing resources, and other aids to help different teams in summarizing two types of big collections: Web pages related to events, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Student teams then deployed different libraries, tools, methods, and algorithms to solve the task of big data text summarization. Summarization is an ideal problem to address learning NLP since it involves all levels of linguistics, as well as many of the tools and techniques used by NLP practitioners. The evaluation results showed that all teams generated coherent and readable summaries. Many summaries were of high quality and accurately described their corresponding events or ETD chapters, and the teams produced them along with NLP pipelines in a single semester. Further, both undergraduate and graduate students gave statistically significant positive feedback, relative to other courses in the Department of Computer Science. Accordingly, we encourage educators in the data and information management field to use our approach or similar methods in their teaching and hope that other researchers will also use our data sets and synergistic solutions to approach the new and challenging tasks we addressed. © 2020 Liuqing Li et al., published by Sciendo","big data text analytics; computer science education; deep learning; information system education; machine learning; natural language processing; NLP; problem-based learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105487053"

However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. This study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. Findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions. © 2020","Engineering design; Learning analytics; Longitudinal clustering; Self-regulated learning; STEM education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083457002"

Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics. © 2019","Energy3D; Engineering design; Learning analytics; Self-regulation; STEM learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071284409"

Although the library literature includes many articles about librarian perceptions on this matter, this paper adds rich, qualitative evidence to the limited research available about student preferences for how libraries should handle information about what they search for, borrow, and download. This paper covers acceptable and unacceptable uses of student search data based on American undergraduate student perspectives. This is an important area of study due to the increasingly data-driven nature of evaluation, accountability, and improvement in higher education, which relies on individual-level student data for learning analytics. These practices are sometimes at odds with libraries’ longstanding commitment to user privacy, which has historically limited the amount of data collected about student use of materials. However, libraries’ use of student search data is increasing. Methods – This qualitative study was approached through interpretive description, a rigorous qualitative framework for answering practical research questions in an applied setting or discipline. I employed the constant comparative method of data collection and analysis to conduct semi-structured interviews with 27 undergraduate students at a large, American, urban public research institution. Interviews included questions as well as vignettes: short scenarios designed to elicit response. Through inductive coding, I organized the data into interpretive themes and subthemes to describe student attitudes. Results – Participants viewed academic library search data as less personally revealing than internet search data. As a result, students were generally comfortable with libraries collecting search data so long as it is used for their benefit. They were comfortable with data being used to improve library collections and services, but were more ambivalent about use of search data for personalized search results and for learning analytics-based assessment. Students had mixed feelings about using search data in investigations related to criminal activity or national security. Most students expressed a desire for de-identification and user control of data. Students who were not comfortable with their search data being collected or used often held their convictions more strongly than those who found the practice acceptable, and their concerns were often related to how data might be used in ways that harm members of vulnerable groups. Conclusion – The results of this study suggested that librarians should further explore student perspectives about search data collection in academic libraries to consider how and if they might adjust their data collection practices to be respectful of student preferences for privacy, while still meeting evaluation and improvement objectives. This study also introduces the qualitative framework of interpretive description to the library and information science literature, promoting use of this applied qualitative approach, which is well-suited to the practical questions often asked in library research studies. © 2021.

The original courses were completely open and free, targeting the worldwide population. However, current MOOC providers have pivoted towards more private directions, and we often find that MOOC materials are completely closed within their hosting platforms and cannot be retrieved from them by their learners. This diminishes the potential of MOOCs by making content available to a small proportion of learners and severely limits the reusability of the educational resources. In this paper, we present a process that we call 'unMOOCing', in which we transform the resources of a MOOC into OERs. We taught a MOOC on Open Education in the UNED Abierta platform, and we 'unMOOCed' all of its educational resources, making them available to download by the learners that are taking the course. The results of the unMOOCing were very encouraging: the possibility of downloading the course resources was the most highly rated component of the course. Additionally, the two unMOOCed materials that were considered as most useful (presentations and contents in a PDF) were downloaded by 90% of the learners. Now that the majority of MOOC providers are moving towards a more closed educational approach, we believe that this paper sends a powerful message for bringing back the original MOOC concept of 'Openness' with the unMOOCing process, thus contributing to the wider dissemination and democratization of education across the globe. © 2020 by the authors.","Learning analytics; Massive open online courses; Open courseWare; open education; Open educational resources; Technology-enhanced learning; UnMOOCing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091697728"

Modern technology has given faculty new ways to incorporate active learning and increase student engagement in their courses. Although the broad history of technology-enhanced coursework has demonstrated that student learning is usually very comparable to what occurs in traditional coursework, recent studies focusing specifically on blended learning in totally redesigned classes report positive results. Were those positive results due to the online blending or to the redesign of the class? To answer this question and other limitations and challenges in past studies, the authors present their unique research that measures learning in a blended undergraduate management information systems course where identical classes were compared, one being all face-to-face and one being one-third online. By varying only course modality, this research answers the question of whether blended learning is a superior learning environment in an undergraduate MIS class, a second-level MIS class covering ERP, business processes, databases, advanced spreadsheets, and data analytics. Collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, the authors use a critical realism lens to create a mechanism for learning. Quantitative data, analyzed by multiple regression models and qualitative data, analyzed by content analysis lead to the outcome that learning is comparable to traditional coursework, grade-wise, but students prefer face-to-face class time. It also reveals that self-regulatory skills are evident, confirming that blended learning can aid in the construction of learning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blended learning; Constructivism; Critical realism; E-learning; Hybrid learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065389127"

The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit released in May of 2018 shows that among all debt balances, student loans remain the only form of debt that virtually sextupled over the last 15-years, and this trend is not slowing down. Although aggregated trends are important, by definition they are limited in their capabilities to providing researchers, policy- and decision-makers with insights related to individual debt accumulation and, perhaps more importantly, with knowledge about the factors associated with variation of individual debt burden. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this study is to ameliorate this limitation in three meaningful ways. First, this is the first study that offers inferential estimates of the magnitude of student debt accumulation increase across two different decades (1991–2013) and institutional sectors (public 2- and 4-year colleges). Second, these estimates are based on student level undergraduate non-self-reported longitudinal loan debt disbursements. Third, the estimates not only account for individuals’ baseline differences at the moment of college entry, but also account for institution- and state-level indicators that took place during college enrollment and that may be related to the variation of student loan debt reliance. Two nationally representative samples (NELS and ELS) complemented with other institution- and state-level data were analyzed using doubly robust estimators build from propensity score weights and entropy balancing approaches that were robust to unobservable selection issues using Oster’s approach (J Bus Econ Stat 37(2):1–18, 2017). The results consistently indicated that, among all participants, student borrowing participation increased by 15 percentage points in the 2000s, compared to the 1990s, and individual debt accumulation at least doubled across decades. Notably, among 4-year degree holders, the 2-year path toward a 4-year degree consistently resulted in about 10% lower debt accumulation compared to the 4-year path toward a 4-year degree. Students who did not attain a 4-year degree were better served by having started college in the 2-year sector. In terms of overall debt increase, 4-year degree holders accrued about $8000 more on average than their counterparts did during the 1990s, however, the recent cohort also repaid about $11,000 more, on average (or three times as much), than participants did in the 1990s. These higher repayment behaviors observed among 4-year degree holders, resulted in similar amounts of their respective debt balances across decades. The implications are clear: students with higher propensities toward a 4-year degree attainment are likely to incur lower debt if they start college in the community college sector. However, before fully recommending this pathway, 2- and 4-year colleges’ articulation agreements should be strengthened to ease transfer and eventual degree completion. Without recommending consolidation or merger between 2- and 4-year institutions, researchers and policy makers can learn from the strategies implemented by successful cases such as Perimeter College and Georgia State. Finally, 4-year entrants with lower likelihood to attain a 4-year degree may be better served by beginning college in the 2-year sector instead. Predictive analytics and machine learning techniques can be used to identify these cases, as depicted in the discussion section of the study. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Community college effects on student loan debt; Data science; Doubly-robust modeling; Entropy balancing; Higher education finance and college choice; Machine learning; Philosophy of Causation in the social sciences; Predictive analytics; Propensity score weighting; Quasi-causal estimates; Unobservable selection and Coefficient stability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068164940"

Although many of the early learning analytics applications were intended to help teaching professionals to identify at-risk students, some learning analytics applications display information on course progress and performance directly to students. While positive associations between student use of learning analytics and achievement have been reported, some have expressed concern that for at-risk students, low estimated grades might induce negative emotions, which could lead to disengagement or even withdrawal. However, few studies have examined the effects of such applications on at-risk students. Elements of Success is a learning analytics platform that provides students with weekly performance feedback, including a current estimated grade. This study examined the relationship between student use of Elements of Success and academic performance among at-risk students in an introductory chemistry course. Specifically, we compared final grade outcomes and the risk of withdrawal among students who received a low estimated grade after the first midterm. Results indicated that viewing performance feedback, including a low estimated grade, was not associated with withdrawal from the course for at-risk students. Furthermore, at-risk students who used Elements of Success were found to be resilient. After controlling for prior learning outcomes, demographics, and self-reported study skills, it was found that they were more likely to earn a final passing grade (C- or above) than at-risk students who never used it.

Biomineralization in diatoms, unicellular algae that use silica to construct micron-scale cell walls with nanoscale features, is an attractive candidate for functional synthesis of materials for applications including photonics, sensing, filtration, and drug delivery. Therefore, controllably modifying diatom structure through targeted genetic modifications for these applications is a very promising field. In this work, we used gene knockdown in Thalassiosira pseudonana diatoms to create modified strains with changes to structural morphology and linked genotype to phenotype using supervised machine learning. An artificial neural network (NN) was developed to distinguish wild and modified diatoms based on the SEM images of frustules exhibiting phenotypic changes caused by a specific protein (Thaps3_21880), resulting in 94% detection accuracy. Class activation maps visualized physical changes that allowed the NNs to separate diatom strains, subsequently establishing a specific gene that controls pores. A further NN was created to batch process image data, automatically recognize pores, and extract pore-related parameters. Class interrelationship of the extracted paraments was visualized using a multivariate data visualization tool, called CrossVis, and allowed to directly link changes in morphological diatom phenotype of pore size and distribution with changes in the genotype. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067290872"

Student engagement has been shown to vary based on student-instructor interaction. We examined LMS usage of first-year engineering students in a large research university in the United States to examine the following three research questions: 1) How do course grades vary based on the students' instructor and the overall number of LMS sessions per student, 2) How do course grades vary based on the students' instructor and the number of LMS sessions per student for different course tools, and 3) How does the timing and frequency of LMS tool usage relate to course grades and vary across instructors? We found a positive relationship between LMS usage and course grades; however, the relationship is dependent upon the instructor of the course, as well as for the specific type of tool used. We also found that the day of the week on which the LMS was used is a strong predictor of student course grades. The results empirically demonstrate that better engagement with a course leads to better outcomes and there are variations in how instructors use an LMS which ultimately influences student usage and performance. We also illustrate an opportunity for researchers and instructors to capture, analyze, and use LMS data to inform and improve teaching practices and policies. © 2013 IEEE.","Assessment; engagement; engineering education; first-year engineering; learning management systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075605885"

Although 2011 saw the first learning analytics conference, the field draws from a long history of research in associated disciplines such as psychology, statistics, education and computer science. However, the novelty of learning analytics research stems from the access and analysis of large, yet granular, data sources that are generated from student interactions in online activities. The vast array and volume of accessible learning data have promulgated new approaches to understanding and measuring learning. As researchers pursue such algorithmically generated insights, there are parallel challenges to individual ethics and privacy and a broader consideration of the impact of an increased quantification of education.

The goal of this paper is to highlight the advantages of tree-based machine learning algorithms over classic (logistic) regression methods for data-informed decision making in higher education problems, and stress the success of random forest in circumstances where the regression assumptions are often violated in big data applications. Random forest is a model averaging procedure where each tree is constructed based on a bootstrap sample of the data set. In particular, we emphasize the ease of application, low computational cost, high predictive accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of random forest machinery. Our overall recommendation is that institutional researchers look beyond classical regression and single decision tree analytics tools, and consider random forest as the predominant method for prediction tasks. The proposed points of view are detailed and illustrated through a simulation experiment and analyses of data from real institutional research projects. © 2018, University of Maryland.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042404386"

We compared a flipped-classroom setting with the traditional (“control”) setting for an accelerated lower-division general biology course. Student self-reporting and video analytics functions showed ample and variable video viewing among individual students. Student learning was evaluated through quizzes administered after a set of concepts were covered (post 1) and at the end of the course (post 2). Students in the flipped sections had significantly higher quiz scores than students in the control sections for both post 1 and post 2. Analyses of variance analyzing the effect of and interactions between type of instruction, in-class activities, time, and Bloom’s level of the quiz questions found significant differences in the overall model and all the factors, except for the presence and level of activities. Significant differences between students in the flipped and control sections were observed for low-level Bloom’s questions only. Thus, the positive effect of the flipped-classroom approach on student learning may be due to improvements in recall of basic concepts and a better understanding of biology vocabulary in their first biology course. © 2018 A.

Internally we face issues of fragmentation and questions about what progress is being made. Externally the rise of social media and a variety of research communities that study the interactions within it raise questions about our unique identity and larger impact on the world. To illuminate the complex issues involved and the multiple perspectives that exist on them, we conducted an iterative and generative consultation with members of the CSCL community through individual interviews and public interactive presentations. The result is a series of eight provocations for the field, each presented as a dialogue between the Provocateur/Provocatrice (who seeks to shake up the status quo) and the Conciliator (who seeks to build on the achievements of our current traditions). The provocations address the debated need for six things: one conceptual framework to unite our diverse tools and theories (#1), prioritization of learner agency over collaborative scripting (#2), scrupulous scrutiny of when “collaboration” and “community” are said to exist (#3), the pursuit of computational approaches to understand collaborative learning (#5), learning analytics and adaptive support to be a top priority in the field (#6), and the expansion of our focus to seriously address social media and large-scale learning environments (#7). In addition, the provocations highlight two areas in which perhaps we should desist: the attempt to reconcile analytical and interpretative approaches to understanding collaboration (#4), and the goal of achieving tangible change in the education system (#8). There are no resolutions offered in this paper; the interchanges presented are designed to lay out the complex constellation of issues involved and can be considered a dialogue that we are still in the process of having with ourselves as individuals and together as a community. We stress the urgency and importance for the field of CSCL to take up these questions and tensions, and critically, to work towards decisions and resultant actions.

Progress: Over the past 30 years, scholars have defined the preparation needed for teaching and other educator roles, and created faculty development delivery systems to train teachers as educators. To reward the excellence of educators, scholars have expanded definitions of scholarship, defined educator roles and criteria for judging excellence, and developed educator portfolios to make achievements visible for peer review. Despite these efforts, the scholarship of discovery continues to be more highly prized and rewarded than the scholarship of teaching. These values are deeply embedded in university culture and policies. Challenges: To remedy the structural inequalities between researchers and educators, a holistic approach to rewarding the broad range of educational roles and educational scholarship is needed. This requires strong advocacy to create changes in academic rewards and support policies, provide a clear career trajectory for educators using learning analytics, expand programmes for faculty development, support health professions education scholarship units and academies of medical educators, and create mechanisms to ensure high standards for all educators. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026769687"

As a part of the core Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, mathematics is vital to the nation's economic prosperity, yet enrollment in STEM fields at the college/university level has remained relatively stable, despite millions of dollars expended to improve STEM education and retention. Most extant research focuses on innovations within classroom settings that can improve learning outcomes for students pursuing STEM majors. Additional research is needed in examining how the sequencing of courses taken by students can help or hinder their progress toward the successful completion of a STEM degree. In this first phase of our research, quantitative analytics was used to identify the impact of specific courses on students’ risk of dropping out of a Math major. Findings suggest a general inverse correlation between academic performance and attrition: good performance predicts lower attrition rates. Survival analysis indicated that the further a student goes within the math major, the greater the risk of dropping out. Students in a Math major tend to be more likely to drop out after their 4th year compared to their first three years. In general, students show increased inclination to switch majors from their second year and those students who have stayed in the program for too long are very likely to switch to another major. © 2017","Data mining; Learning analytics; Predictive model; Survival analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040519901"

However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of “black box” modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction. Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning. What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes. In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI-based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model-derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and “close-the-loop” by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original. Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human–computer interaction and learning engineering methods. Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. © 2019 The Authors.

YouTube permits worldwide access to high-quality medical education videos; however, no studies have described the reach of medical education videos on YouTube or what topics are preferred. Method One year of YouTube analytics data (February 1, 2016, to January 31, 2017) was collected for a medicaleducation- focused channel called Osmosis. Created December 20, 2015, the channel had 189 disease-focused videos by January 2017. Viewer and subscriber data were analyzed according to the World Bank's four income and seven region classifications. Topic viewing was analyzed according to income level. Results The channel had accumulated 105,117 subscribers and 5,226,405 views for 20,153,093 minutes (38.3 years) from viewers located in 213/218 (97.7%) World Bank economies. While the number of videos increased 4.8-fold from February 2016 to January 2017, monthly views increased 50-fold and subscribers increased 117-fold. Lowor middle-income countries generated 2.2 million (42%) views and 52,942 (50%) subscribers, with similar view proportions across income level during the 12 months. A plurality of views (1.5 million; 29%) came from North America; Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest number (150,065; 2.9%). Topic viewing generally corresponded to population health statistics. Conclusions Medical education content on YouTube can immediately and consistently reach a global viewership with relevant content. Educators may consider posting videos to YouTube to reach a broad audience.

To provide this feedback, there has been a proliferation of educational dashboards in recent years. An educational (learner) dashboard systematically delivers timely and continuous feedback on performance and can provide easily visualized and interpreted performance data. In this paper, we provide practical tips for developing a functional, user-friendly individual learner performance dashboard and literature review of dashboard development, assessment theory, and users’ perspectives. Considering key design principles and maximizing current technological advances in data visualization techniques can increase dashboard utility and enhance the user experience. By bridging current technology with assessment strategies that support learning, educators can continue to improve the field of learning analytics and design of information management tools such as dashboards in support of improved learning outcomes. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033667791"

The educational analytics fields have produced many insights about learning based solely on tutoring systems' automatically logged data, or “log data.” But log data leave out important contextual information about the learning experience. For example, a student working at a computer might be working independently with few outside influences. Alternatively, he or she might be in a lively classroom, with other students around, talking and offering suggestions. Tools that capture these other experiences have potential to augment and complement log data. However, the collection of rich, multimodal data streams and the increased complexity and heterogeneity in the resulting data pose many challenges to researchers. Here, we present two empirical studies that take advantage of multimodal data sources to enrich our understanding of student learning. We leverage and extend quantitative models of student learning to incorporate insights derived jointly from data collected in multiple modalities (log data, video, and high-fidelity audio) and contexts (individual vs. collaborative classroom learning). We discuss the unique benefits of multimodal data and present methods that take advantage of such benefits while easing the burden on researchers' time and effort. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","collaborative learning; intelligent tutoring systems; log data; multi-modal data analytics; natural language processing; STEM education","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055712339"

Evaluation may be enhanced through learner analytics (LA)–analysis of quantitative audience usage data generated by video-sharing platforms. Methods and results: We applied LA to an experimental series of ten VBLs on electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation, uploaded to YouTube in the model of a publicly accessible MOOC. Trends in view count; total percentage of video viewed and audience retention (AR) (percentage of viewers watching at a time point compared to the initial total) were examined. The pattern of average AR decline was characterized using regression analysis, revealing a uniform linear decline in viewership for each video, with no evidence of an optimal VBL length. Segments with transient increases in AR corresponded to those focused on core concepts, indicative of content requiring more detailed evaluation. We propose a model for applying LA at four levels: global, series, video, and feedback. Discussion and conclusions: LA may be a useful tool in evaluating a VBL series. Our proposed model combines analytics data and learner self-report for comprehensive evaluation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033370931"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected a mixture of publicly accessible and privately disclosed syllabi from 8,302 library and information science (LIS) courses to extract privacy language. Using privacy concepts from the literature and emergent themes, the authors analyzed the corpus. Findings: Most syllabi did not mention privacy (98 percent). Privacy tended to be mentioned in the context of digital tools, course communication, policies and assignments. Research limitations/implications: The transferability of the findings is limited because they address only one field and professional discipline, LIS, and address syllabi for only online and hybrid courses. Practical implications: The findings suggest a need for professional development for instructors related to student data privacy. The discussion provides recommendations for creating educational experiences that support syllabi development and constructive norming opportunities. Social implications: Instructors may be making assumptions about the degree of privacy literacy among their students or not value student privacy. Each raises significant concerns if privacy is instrumental to intellectual freedom and processes critical to the educational experience. Originality/value: In an age of educational data mining and analytics, this is one of the first studies to consider if and how instructors are addressing student data privacy in their courses, and the study initiates an important conversation for reflecting on privacy values and practices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethics; Higher education; Learning analytics; Privacy; Student privacy; Syllabi","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071285450"

This paper is by and primarily for practitioners. We suggest implementation strategies that consider the human factor in adopting new technologies by analyzing the viability of our Learning Analytics Fellows Program (LAFP), where faculty are empowered as agents of institutional change. This program directly addresses known barriers to the use of LA, dealing with culture management, adoption, and sustainability. The Fellows program engages faculty in inquiry about student success, providing them with a view of the student experience through institutional data. Faculty, with their knowledge of students and programs as well as their research expertise, are well-positioned to advance LA efforts on our campuses. In our case, faculty are also the end users of their findings, and are able to provide input into the design of the analytical tools created for them. Expanding on a paper presented at the LAK 18 conference (Rehrey, Groth, Fiorini, Hostetter, & Shepard, 2018), we describe the rationale for the implementation strategy, reflect on the effectiveness of this strategy by analyzing self-reports from our LAFP, and consider the broader impacts of this approach for the future. © 2019, UTS ePRESS.

Such approaches address social justice by increasing student agency and voice in the classroom, and support all learners in achieving success. While personalized learning can increase teacher workloads significantly, modern digital tools are at last making it more efficient and logistically feasible. This case study investigated the effectiveness of a web-based learning visualization tool, CGScholar’s Analytics, to support mastery learning through formative assessment, peer collaboration, and adaptive and personalized instruction. It found that the visual representation of students’ progress in CGScholar’s Analytics clarified their learning goals and increased their sense of agency, self-regulation of their learning, motivation, and effort. Students provided constructive feedback to peers and developed a greater appreciation of how peer collaboration supported their learning. The feedback by peers and the teacher provided adaptive and personalized instruction, and promoted selfreflection and metacognition, enabling students to progress to mastery. Further, the increased student agency and collaboration contributed to creating a more socially just classroom. © Common Ground, Rita van Haren, Jessica Harroun, All Rights Reserved.","Adaptive; Assessment; Mastery; Peer Collaboration; Personalized; Self-regulation; Social Justice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073335782"

The aim of this study was to examine the association between the students' self-reported study habits and active learning practices necessary for meaningful learning in the flipped/blended classroom. A convenience sample of two classes of second-year dental students in spring 2014 (SP14, n=106) and spring 2015 (SP15, n=106) was invited to participate in the study. Of the SP14 students, 84 participated, for a response rate of 79%; of the SP15 students, 94 participated, for a response rate of 87%. Students' self-reported responses to questions about study strategies with the prerecorded lecture materials and assigned reading materials were examined. Non-parametric analyses resulted in a cohort effect, so data are reported by class. In the SP15 class, 72% reported watching all/more than half of the prerecorded lectures versus 62% of the SP14 class, with a majority watching more than one lecture per week. In the SP15 cohort, 68% used active learning strategies when watching the lectures versus 58.3% of the SP14 cohort. The time of day preferred by the majority of both cohorts for interacting with course materials was 7-11 pm. Both SP14 and SP15 students reported being unlikely to read assigned materials prior to coming to class. Overall, the course redesign appeared to engage students in self-directed active learning. However, the degree to which active learning practices were taking place to achieve meaningful learning was questionable given students' self-reported study strategies. More work is needed to examine strategies for promoting study practices that will lead to meaningful learning. © 2018 American Dental Education Association.

Heterogeneity in grading between courses systematically biases observed GPAs for individual students: the GPA observed depends on course selection. We show how a logistic model can account for course selection by simulating how every student in a sample would perform if they took all available courses, giving a new “modeled GPA.” We then use 10 years of grade data from a large university to demonstrate that this modeled GPA is a more accurate predictor of student performance in individual courses than the observed GPA. Using Computer Science (CS) as an example learning analytics application, it is found that required CS courses give significantly lower grades than average courses. This depresses the recorded GPAs of CS majors: modeled GPAs are 0.25 points higher than those that are observed. The modeled GPA also correlates much more closely with standardized test scores than the observed GPA: the correlation with Math ACT is 0.37 for the modeled GPA and is 0.20 for the observed GPA. This implies that standardized test scores are much better predictors of student performance than might otherwise be assumed. © 2018 ACM.","Gender disparity; GPA; Learning analytics; Women in computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053759148"

Recently, technological advances such as robot-assisted surgery have created great opportunities for objective surgical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a predictive framework for objective skill assessment based on movement trajectory data. Our aim is to build a classification framework to automatically evaluate the performance of surgeons with different levels of expertise. Methods: Eight global movement features are extracted from movement trajectory data captured by a da Vinci robot for surgeons with two levels of expertise – novice and expert. Three classification methods – k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression and support vector machines – are applied. Results: The result shows that the proposed framework can classify surgeons' expertise as novice or expert with an accuracy of 82.3% for knot tying and 89.9% for a suturing task. Conclusion: This study demonstrates and evaluates the ability of machine learning methods to automatically classify expert and novice surgeons using global movement features.

The prediction of learning outcomes can be used to act on students in order to improve their learning process. Several studies have addressed the prediction of learning outcomes in intelligent tutoring systems environments with intensive use of exercises, but few of them addressed this prediction in other web-based environments with intensive use not only of exercises but also, for example, of videos. In addition, most works on prediction of learning outcomes are based on low level indicators such as number of accesses or time spent in resources. In this paper, we approach the prediction of learning gains in an educational experience using a local instance of Khan Academy platform with an intensive use of exercises and taking into account not only low level indicators but also higher level indicators such as students' behaviours. Our proposed regression model is able to predict 68% of the learning gains variability with the use of six variables related to the learning process. We discuss these results providing explanation of the influence of each variable in the model and comparing these results with other prediction models from other works.

Engaging in the formal and informal curriculum, students learn to achieve desired outcomes in novel situations, perform comfortably with uncertainty, and are often recognized for creative problem-solving. Students learn by asking and answering their own and others’ questions. They readily operate at the metacognitive level, anticipating events, self-monitoring, and checking decisions and emotions. A key function of the reflective process is to identify gaps or shortcomings in the thinking process. The adaptive learner shifts into reflective thinking when confronted with complex contextual and situational demands. We are only beginning to understand how to create educational pathways to foster adaptive learning. An essential focus is the adaptive teacher who frames learning and assessment around predictive analytics, reflective spaced practice, and authentic learning material. To be effective, the teacher must engage the learner outside the formal classroom in the parallel curriculum. A major premise is that learning occurs individually and together with peers, teachers, and team members in multiple contexts. During the learning process, the learner readily operates at the metacognitive level, anticipating behavior, self-monitoring and assessing, and checking theirs and others decisions and emotions. The adaptive medical curriculum provides the pathway for such learning. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050408467"

Informed by a critical literature synthesis from the fields of cognitive science, history, philosophy, education, technology, ethics, and library science, this analysis situates learning analytics in the context of communication and education technologies as tools in the manipulation of attention. The article begins by defining attention as both a cognitive activity and a metaphysical state intrinsic to intellectual freedom. The Progressive Era concept of attention engineering is then introduced and reinterpreted in the context of attention scarcity and academic capitalism in the Knowledge Era. The affordances of information and communications technology replicated in educational technology to facilitate data capture, analysis, and intervention in the form of “nudge” learning analytics are outlined as evidence of contemporary attention engineering in education. Attention engineering in education is critiqued as antithetical to students’ intellectual freedom and development as self-sufficient learners and independent thinkers.

This study used transition-rate analysis, entropy-analysis, and sequential pattern mining to analyze the chat message of 144 students of two-year colleges. The participants worked on tasks related to Ohm's Law in a simulation-based collaborative-inquiry-learning environment. The results revealed that students in groups who completed tasks successfully tended to ensure that everyone in their group had a shared understanding of the relationship between the variables before they moved on to the next step. In contrast, students in groups who did not complete tasks successfully were more likely to regulate the process without reaching a shared understanding.

The majority of the research into Twitter-based professional learning communities has investigated why educators choose to use Twitter for professional development and learning and what they actually do in these communities. However, few studies have examined why certain community members remain committed and others gradually drop out. To fill this gap in the research, this study investigated how some key features of online discourse influenced the continued participation of the members of a Twitter-based professional learning community. More than 600,000 tweets generated over six years under the hashtag #edchat were gathered. Online discourse was deconstructed to the cognitive dimension, the interactive dimension, and the social dimension. Text-mining methods were then used to automatically identify these dimensions in the tweets. Finally, survival analysis was used to quantify the influences of these dimensions on users’ commitment time to the Twitter community. The implications of the results and findings are then discussed.

Archival data from 167 graduate level education students enrolled in 4 different programs and 9 different online courses were analyzed to determine whether a relationship existed between grades earned and time spent in specific areas within the course: total course time, course modules, document repository, and synchronous online sessions. Time spent in each component did not predict a specific letter grade, but did predict whether or not an A would be achieved. The sample was composed of students from four different graduate education programs: Educational Leadership, Reading, Instructional Design, and Special Education. Variations found among programs did not significantly predict the grade earned in the course. A logistic regression revealed that of all the predictor variables, time spent in synchronous online sessions alone showed as a significant predictor of receiving an A in the course.

A student-created wiki was established to serve as a repository of study tools for students in a medical school curriculum. There is a scarcity of information describing student-led creation of wikis in medical education. Objective: The aim is to characterize website traffic of a student-created wiki and evaluate student perceptions of usage via a short anonymous online survey. Methods: Website analytics were used to track visitation statistics to the wiki and a survey was distributed to assess ease of use, interest in contributing to the wiki, and suggestions for improvement. Results: Site traffic data indicated high usage, with a mean of 315 (SD 241) pageviews per day from July 2011 to March 2013 and 74,317 total user sessions. The mean session duration was 1.94 (SD 1.39) minutes. Comparing Fall 2011 to Fall 2012 sessions revealed a large increase in returning visitors (from 12,397 to 20,544, 65.7%) and sessions via mobile devices (831 to 1560, 87.7%). The survey received 164 responses; 88.0% (162/184) were aware of the wiki at the time of the survey. On average, respondents felt that the wiki was more useful in the preclinical years (mean 2.73, SD 1.25) than in the clinical years (mean 1.88, SD 1.12; P<.001). Perceived usefulness correlated with the percent of studying for which the respondent used electronic resources (Spearman ?=.414, P<.001). Conclusions: Overall, the wiki was a highly utilized, although informal, part of the curriculum with much room for improvement and future exploration. © Michael Pascoe, Forrest Monroe, Helen Macfarlane.","Analytics; Constructivist learning; Medical education; Wiki","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048892113"

But analyses of the effectiveness of such interventions can be confounded by measures of students’ prior learning as well as their baseline level of self-regulated learning. For this research study, we sought to examine whether the frequency of accessing a dashboard was associated with learning outcomes after matching subjects on confounding variables. And because prior research has suggested that measures of prior learning are associated with students’ likelihood to use learning analytics interventions, we sought to adequately control for learners’ likelihood to access the feedback by using a propensity score matching with a non-binary treatment variable. We administered the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and also collected demographic information for a propensity score matching process. Users’ frequency of accessing the intervention was categorized as High, Moderate, or Low/No usage. After matching users on characteristics associated with dashboard usage (gender, high school GPA, and the “Test Anxiety” and “Self Efficacy” factors) we found that both the “High” and “Moderate” users achieved significantly higher course grades than the “Low/No” users. The results suggest learners benefited from regularly accessing the feedback, but extreme amounts of usage were not necessary to achieve a positive effect. We discuss the implications for recommending how students use learning analytics interventions without excessively accessing feedback. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Feedback; Learning analytics; Motivation; Propensity score matching; Self-regulated learners","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035084698"

However, preparedness and realistic perceptions are important factors for student retention. With regard to a proposed model of five academic competencies (time management, learning skills, technology proficiency, self-monitoring, and research skills), incoming students’ perceptions concerning academic staff support and students’ self-reported confidence at a German university were examined. Using quantitative data, an initial exploratory study was conducted (N = 155), which revealed first-year students’ perceptions of the role of academic staff in supporting their development, especially in research skills, as well as low self-reported confidence in this competence. Thus, a follow up study (N = 717) was conducted to confirm these findings as well as to provide an in-depth understanding of research skills. Understanding students’ perceptions is crucial if higher education institutions are to meet students’ needs and provide adequate support services in the challenging first year. Thus, in order to increase student retention, it is suggested that universities assist first-year students in developing academic competencies through personalised competence-based programs and with the help of emerging research fields and educational technologies such as learning analytics and digital badges. © 2018, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.

Manufacturing engineers, however, often lack the expertise to apply advanced analytics, relying instead on frequent consultations with data scientists. Furthermore, collaborations between manufacturing engineers and data scientists have resulted in highly specialized applications that are not relevant to broader use cases. The manufacturing industry can benefit from the techniques applied in these collaborations if they can be generalized for a wide range of manufacturing problems without requiring a strong knowledge about analytical models. This paper first presents a model-based methodology to help manufacturing engineers who have little or no experience in advanced analytics apply machine learning techniques for manufacturing problems. This methodology includes a meta-model repository and model transformations. The meta-models define concepts and rules that are commonly known in the manufacturing industry in order to facilitate the creation of manufacturing models. The model transformations enable the semi-automatic generation of analytical models using a given manufacturing model. Second, a model-based Tool for ADvanced Analytics in Manufacturing (TADAM) is presented to allow manufacturing engineers to apply the methodology. TADAM offers capabilities to generate neural networks for manufacturing process problems. Using TADAM's graphical user interface, a manufacturing engineer can build a model for a given process to provide: 1) the key performance indicator (KPI) to be predicted, and 2) the variables contributing to this KPI. Once the manufacturing engineer has built the model and provided the associated data, the model transformations available in TADAM can be called to generate a trained neural network. Finally, the benefits of TADAM are demonstrated in a manufacturing use case in which a manufacturing engineer generates a neural network to predict the energy consumption of a milling process. © 2017","Advanced analytics; Manufacturing; Milling; Model-based; Neural network","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036644906"

The progression of big data analytics framework must be clearly understood so that novel approaches can be developed to advance this state-of-the-art discipline. An ignorance of observing the progression of this fast-growing discipline may lead to duplications in research and waste of efforts. Its main companion field, machine learning, helps solve many big data analytics problems; therefore, it is also important to understand the progression of machine learning in the big data analytics framework. One of the current research efforts in big data analytics is the integration of deep learning and Bayesian optimization, which can help the automatic initialization and optimization of hyperparameters of deep learning and enhance the implementation of iterative algorithms in software. The hyperparameters include the weights used in deep learning, and the number of clusters in Bayesian mixture models that characterize data heterogeneity. The big data analytics research also requires computer systems and software that are capable of storing, retrieving, processing, and analyzing big data that are generally large, complex, heterogeneous, unstructured, unpredictable, and exposed to scalability problems. Therefore, it is appropriate to introduce a new research topic—transformative knowledge discovery—that provides a research ground to study and develop smart machine learning models and algorithms that are automatic, adaptive, and cognitive to address big data analytics problems and challenges. The new research domain will also create research opportunities to work on this interdisciplinary research space and develop solutions to support research in other disciplines that may not have expertise in the research area of big data analytics. For example, the research, such as detection and characterization of retinal diseases in medical sciences and the classification of highly interacting species in environmental sciences can benefit from the knowledge and expertise in big data analytics.

This paper reports on that panel discussion, which focused on questions such as what a data science degree is and what a data science program’s learning objectives are. The panel also debated if there should be different types of data science-related programs (such as an applied data science program or a business analytics program) and, if so, should there be a common core across the different variations of programs.

However, business students not majoring in data analytics have limited credit hours available for data analytics. Therefore, it is necessary to select data analytics topics that meet employers’ needs. We hypothesized that surveying industry advisors would help us revise the current curriculum to incorporate data analytics learning objectives that are both necessary and sufficient. The results showed that the most important data competencies are basic spreadsheet skills (86%), intermediate spreadsheet skills (82%), retrieving relevant data (86%), documenting data (92%), and presenting data (96%). The least important area is teaching software programming to non-analytics majors (14.5%).

However, due to its open nature and complexity, providing timely support to students has been challenging using the traditional assessment methods. This study takes an initial step to employ learning analytics to build performance prediction models to help struggling students. It allows instructors to offer in-time intervention and support for these at-risk students. Specifically, we develop a task model to characterize the engineering design process so that the data features can be associated with the abstract engineering design phases. A two-stage feature selection method is proposed to address the data sparsity and high dimensionality problems. Then, instead of relying on probability-based algorithms such as Bayesian Networks to represent the task model, this study used the Radial Basis Function based Support Vector Machines for prediction to identify the struggling students. Next, we employ an extra-tree classification method to rank the importance of these features. Teachers can integrate the feature importance ranking with the abstract task model to diagnose students’ problems for scaffolding design. The results show that the proposed approach can outperform the baseline models as well as providing actionable insights for teachers to provide personalized and timely feedback to students. Implications of this study for research and practice are then discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithms; educational data mining; engineering design; feature selection; Learning analytics; predictive modeling","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074505545"

Background Computer science education in the K-2 educational segment is receiving a growing amount of attention as national and state educational frameworks are emerging. By focusing on the app ScratchJr, the most popular free introductory block-based programming language for early childhood, this paper explores if there is a relationship between the presence of state frameworks and ScratchJr's frequency of use. Methodology This paper analyzes quantitative non-identifying data from Google Analytics on users of the ScratchJr programming app. Google Analytics is a free tool that allows access to user activity as it happens in real time on the app, as well as au-dience demographics and behavior. An analysis of trends by state, time of year, type of in-app activities completed, and more are analyzed with a specific focus on comparing states with K-12 Computer Science in place versus those without. Contribution Results demonstrate the importance of having state standards in place to in-crease young children's exposure to coding and powerful ideas from computer science in the early years. Moreover, we see preliminary evidence that states with Computer Science standards in place support skills like perseverance and de-bugging through ScratchJr. Findings Findings show that in the case of ScratchJr, app usage decreases during the summer months and on weekends, which may indicate that coding with ScratchJr is more often happening in school than at home. Results also show that states with Computer Science standards have more ScratchJr users on aver-The Case of ScratchJr 114 age and have more total sessions with the app on average. Results also show preliminary evidence that states with Computer Science standards in place have longer average session duration as well as a higher average number of users re-turning to edit an existing project. Recommendations for Practitioners Successful early childhood computer science education programs must teach powerful ideas from the discipline of computer science in a developmentally appropriate way, provide means for self-expression, prompt debugging and problem solving, and offer a low-floor/high-ceiling interface for both novices and experts. Practitioners should be aware in drops in computer science learn-ing during the summer months when school is not in session. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should consider the impact of state and national frameworks on computer science learning and skills mastered during the early childhood years. Researchers should look for ways to continue engaging students in computer science education during times when school is not in session. Impact on Society Results demonstrate the importance of having state CS standards in place to increase young children's exposure to coding and powerful ideas from computer science in the early years. Moreover, we see preliminary evidence that states with Computer Science standards in place support skills like perseverance and de-bugging through ScratchJr. Future Research Future research should continue collecting Google Analytics from the ScratchJr app and track changes in usage. Future research should also collect analytics from a wide range of programming applications for young children to see if the trends identified here are consistent across different apps. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.","Coding; Computer science; Early childhood; Frameworks; Policies; STEM","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084244371"

However, little has been done to examine different patterns of students with different SRL profiles over time, which precludes providing optimal on-going instructional support for individual students. To address the gap in research, we applied learning analytics to analyze log data from 284 undergraduate students enrolled in an asynchronous online statistics course. Specifically, we identified student SRL profiles, and examined the actual student SRL learning patterns. The k-medoids clustering identified three self-regulated learning profiles: self-regulation, partial self-regulation, and non-self-regulation. Self-regulated students showed more study regularity and help-seeking, than did the other two groups of students. The partially self-regulated students showed high study regularity but inactive help-seeking, while the non-self-regulated students exhibited less study regularity and less frequent help-seeking than the other two groups; their self-reported time management scores were significantly lower. The analysis of each week's log variables using the random forest algorithm revealed that self-regulated students studied course content early before exams and sought help during the general exam period, whereas non-self-regulated students studied the course content during the general exam period. Based on our findings, we provide instructional strategies that can be used to support student SRL. We also discuss implications of this study for advanced learning analytics research, and the design of effective asynchronous online courses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asynchronous online courses; Education data mining; Instructional strategies; Learning analytics; Self-regulated learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054184493"

We begin by describing the nature of the data transmitted between the student's client machine and the database server, and our initial database schema for storing interaction log data. We describe many problems that we encountered, with the nature of the problems categorized as syntactic-level data collection issues, issues with relating events to users, or issues with tracking users over time. Relating events to users and tracking the time spent on tasks are both prerequisites to converting syntactic-level interaction streams to semantic-level behavior needed for higher-order analysis of the data. Finally, we describe changes made to our database schema that helped to resolve many of the issues that we had encountered.

The first pilot study conducted in an online course showed both early promises and challenges with this effort. In particular, students reported usefulness of the toolkit for monitoring posting behaviors and setting participation goals. Content analysis of post content linked tool usage with students' increased attempts to solicit peer responses to their posts and increased reflection on individual participation.

Using qualitative analysis, multilevel modelling, and data-mining techniques, we investigated the relationship between student engagement in transformative and non-transformative learning processes and learning outcomes. The results revealed that by using the appropriate feature engineering and algorithms, we could build accurate machine-learning models that could automatically identify transformative and non-transformative discussions on a large scale. Additional qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that when groups engaged in additional interpretation and sustained mutual understanding, their members tended to have statistically better individual-learning outcomes. These analyses also indicated that when groups engaged in additional orientation and proposition generation, their learning outcomes were statistically lower.

The review scope within this paper includes an observation of possible causal aspects within the non-ideal completion rates in online learning environments and an identification of recommended strategies to increase retention rates. Background While online learning is increasingly popular, and the number of online students is steadily growing, student retention rates are significantly lower than those in the traditional environment. Despite the multitude of studies, many institutions are still searching for solutions for this matter. Methodology A systematic literature review was conducted on 40 studies published between 2010 and 2018. We established a set of criteria to guide the selection of eligible articles including topic relevance (aligned with the research questions), empirical studies, and publication time frame. Further steps were performed through a major database searching, abstract screening, full-text analysis, and synthesis process. Contribution This study adds to expanding literature regarding student retention and strategies in online learning environments within the higher education setting. Findings Revealed factors include institutional support, the level difficulty of the programs, promotion of a sense of belonging, facilitation of learning, course design, student behavioral characteristics, and demographic variables along with other personal variables. The recommended strategies identified for improving student retention are early interventions, at-all-times supports for students, effective communication, support for faculty teaching online classes, high-quality instructional feedback and strategies, guidance to foster positive behavioral characteristics, and collaboration among stakeholders to support online students. Recommendations for Practitioners Since factors within the open systems of online learning are interrelated, we recommend a collective effort from multiple stakeholders when addressing retention issues in online learning. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend that fellow scholars consider focusing on each influential factor and recommendation in regard to student retention in online learning environments as synthesized in this study. Findings will further enrich the literature on student retention in online learning environments. Future Research Future research may investigate various data-mining and analytics techniques pertaining to detection and prediction of at-risk students, the efficacy of student support and faculty support programs, and ways to encourage struggling students to adopt effective strategies that potentially engender positive learning behaviors. © Journal of Information Technology Education: Research.","Higher education; Instructional strategies; Online learning; Student retention","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065063254"

The purpose of this work was to demonstrate feasibility and to develop and collect initial validity evidence for a computer-generated dynamic engagement score based on student interactions in an online learning environment, in this case virtual patients used for clinical education. Methods: The study involved third-year medical students using virtual patient cases as a standard component of their educational program at more than 125 accredited US and Canadian medical schools. The engagement metric algorithm included four equally weighted components of student interactions with the virtual patient. We developed a self-report measure of motivational, emotional, and cognitive engagement and conducted confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of the survey responses. We gathered additional validity evidence through educator reviews, factor analysis of the metric, and correlations between student use of the engagement metric and self-report measures of learner engagement. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis substantiated the hypothesized four-factor structure of the survey scales. Educator reviews demonstrated a high level of agreement with content and scoring cut-points (mean Pearson correlation 0.98; mean intra-class correlation 0.98). Confirmatory factor analysis yielded an acceptable fit to a one-factor model of the engagement score components. Correlations of the engagement score with self-report measures were statistically significant and in the predicted directions. Conclusions: We present initial validity evidence for a dynamic online engagement metric based on student interactions in a virtual patient case. We discuss potential uses of such an engagement metric including better understanding of student interactions with online learning, improving engagement through instructional design and interpretation of learning analytics output. © 2018 The Author(s).","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053512462"

Despite widespread use and plentiful theoretical models, empirical understanding of and support for reflection in health professions education remains limited due to simple manual assessment and rare feedback to students. Recent moves to digital reflection practices offer opportunities to computationally study and support reflection as a part of SRL. The critical task in such an endeavor, and the goal of this paper, is to align high-level reflection qualities that are valued conceptually with low-level features in the data that are possible to extract computationally. This paper approaches this goal by (a) developing a unified framework for conceptualizing reflection analytics in health professions education and (b) empirically examining potential data features through which these elements can be assessed. Synthesizing the prior literature yields a conceptual framework for health professions reflection comprised of six elements: Description, Analysis, Feelings, Perspective, Evaluation, and Outcome. These elements then serve as the conceptual grounding for the computational analysis in which 27 dental students’ reflections (in six reflective statement types) over the course of 4 years were examined using selected LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) indices. Variation in elements of reflection across students, years, and reflection-types supports use of the multi-dimensional analysis framework to (a) increase precision of research claims; (b) evaluate whether reflection activities are engaged in as intended; and (c) diagnose aspects of reflection in which specific students need support. Implications for the development of health professions reflection analytics that can contribute to SRL and promising areas for future research are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dental education; Health professions education; Learning analytics; Natural language processing; Professional education; Reflection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063761918"

Design: We built a HIPAA-compliant web-based Platform for comprehensive management of resident education information, including resident operative performance evaluations. To assess evaluation timeliness, we compared the lag time for Platform-based evaluations to that of end-of-rotation evaluations. We also assessed evaluation compliance, based on a time threshold of 5 days for Platform evaluations and 2 weeks for end-of-rotation evaluations. Setting: University of Massachusetts, Baystate Medical Center, General Surgery Residency. Participants: Twenty three attendings and 43 residents for the Platform cohort; 15 services and 45 residents for the end-of-rotation cohort. Results: Three hundred and fifty-eight Platform evaluations were completed by 23 attendings for 43 residents for March through October 2017. Six hundred and ten end-of-rotation evaluations by 15 attendings for 45 residents were used for comparison (September 2015 through June 2017). Of Platform evaluations, 41.3% were completed within 24 hours of the operation (16.5% in 6 hours, 33.3% in 12 hours, and 62.2% in 48 hours), with 24.3% of evaluations completed within 3 hours after e-mail reminders. In the first 6 weeks (March 1 through April 12) 4.5 ± 3.7 evaluations were completed per week compared to 18.8 ± 5.8 in the last (September 18 through October 31). Evaluation lag times improved with the use of the Platform, both for median lag of 35 days earlier (1 ± 1.5 days Platform, 36 ± 28.2 days traditional, p < 0.0001) and a mean lag of 41 days earlier (3.0 ± 4.7 days Platform, 44.0 ± 32.6 days traditional, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our comprehensive Platform facilitated faculty compliance with evaluation requirements and timeliness of availability of performance information (often in near real time) for both residents and residency leadership. The added value of the Platform's integration of evaluations with resident and attending case logging may account for the rapidly increasing number of operative skill evaluations over the short time span since implementation. © 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","educational platform; O-Score; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Resident operative evaluations; Surgical data management; Systems-Based Practice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050826890"

These and other factors, including decreasing public support for colleges and universities, mean that student success is increasingly paramount as a strategic goal for postsecondary institutions. While institutional-level activities such as increased funding for and emphasis on student advising and predictive analytics are crucial, they are insufficient for postsecondary institutions to realize broad and consistent student success. Instead, institutions can look to practices at the curriculum and course level to further student success. This article examines those learning design and teaching practices that constitute the overlap between a) higher education research and trends and b) the lessons learned from at-scale learning experiments. Postsecondary research has shown the effectiveness of practices supported by longitudinal data (high-impact practices), represent a confluence of effective learning design and teaching practices (high-impact teaching practices), and focus attention on lowering the costs of education, thereby making access to postsecondary education at least somewhat more equitable (open-educational resources). An analysis of at-scale learning experiments at the University of Colorado allows the layering of relevant and timely examples of specific MOOC design practices on top of the higher-education research and trends framework, illustrating the ways these two strands of student-success practices mutually reinforce one another. © 2018, National Research University Higher School of Economics.","High-impact practices; High-impact teaching practices; Learning design; MOOC; Open-education resources; Scholarship on teaching and learning; Student success; University of Colorado","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057714345"

However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.","deep learning; dropout prediction; intervention; machine learning; MOOCs; personalization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044095712"

Funes remembers everything, which is to say he forgets nothing. l will use Borges' story as the backdrop for my response to Professor Selwyn. My commentary is in three parts. First, I begin by stating some core areas of agreement, of which there are many. Second, I examine Selwyn’s use of the word “data”. I argue that it perpetuates a number of common misconceptions about statistics and the scientific method. We cannot understand the importance of learning analytics without first clarifying these misconceptions and moving beyond them. In the course of my argument I challenge Selwyn’s central thesis that “Education is inherently social, inherently contextual, inherently subjective; it means you can’t objectively rate it, measure it, indicate it.” Third, I turn the table on Selwyn. As a critic of learning analytics Selwyn suggests that data “disadvantages large numbers of people”. I argue that the root problem in education is the status quo, which Selwyn unwittingly represents, and not learning analytics. If we care about equity in education, as part of a broader interest in social justice, then learning analytics and the use of educational data can be a powerful instrument for empowering the disadvantaged. © 2019, ePRESS.

The purpose of this paper is to document the implementation and assessment of this service and to seek to demonstrate that research consultations provided by NCU librarians contribute to students’ learning and success. Design/methodology/approach: Research consultations are scheduled using Springshare LibCal and are conducted via Citrix GoToMeeting. Students report their satisfaction and skills learned via the Research Consultation Satisfaction Survey. Dissertation chairs and faculty instructors complete separate surveys, which assess the effect that research consultations had on their students’ work. All surveys were created using Qualtrics. Findings: Assessment data reveal that students are satisfied with the research consultation service and can identify specific skills learned. Additionally, faculty and dissertation chairs report an improvement in students’ citations and ability to locate relevant sources. Future research may include examination of learning analytics or citation analysis for students who participated in research consultations. Originality/value: Research consultations are rarely documented in the scholarly literature. An opportunity exists to make virtual research consultations more widely adopted as a distinct library reference service, and further, to measure the impact of this service. This project demonstrates how to successfully implement and assess online research consultations. Techniques discussed may be used in 100 per cent virtual environments, as well as within traditional, brick and mortar schools that may already offer face-to-face research consultations. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Education; Electronic publishing; Electronic reference services; Libraries; Libraries; Library instruction; Library services; Research consultations; Research skills; Special libraries; Technology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048884658"

An online, interactive version of the original paper version of the Wyoming Student Atlas was developed using story mapping technology. Studies on best practices for data-driven storytelling and web map interaction were used to inform the transition of the atlas from a traditional paper format to a collection of story maps. Evaluation of the atlas story maps for educational purposes was conducted by observing students from multiple classrooms as they used the story maps in a lesson. The students and educators responded to a survey after using the story maps. Results of the survey show positive responses to the atlas story maps, including ease of use and preference over a traditional paper atlas.

By applying learning analytics techniques to library use and instructional data, libraries have especially focused on attempting to measure the impact of the library on student GPA, retention, and attainment measures. Because learning analytics studies typically require large datasets of personally identifiable information (PII), they present inherent risks to the privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy of research subjects, who often are unaware and uninformed of the data collected. This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis of learning analytics studies in libraries that examine the effects of library use on measures of student success. Based on the aggregate results, we argue that outcomes of these studies have not produced findings that justify the loss of privacy and risk borne by students. Moreover, we argue that basing high-impact decisions on studies with no, or low, effect sizes, and weak correlation or regression values, has the potential to harm students, particularly those in already vulnerable populations. Finally, we believe that these studies also have the potential to harm institutions that rely on these particular analytical approaches to make crucial business and educational decisions. © 2019 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073744729"

For this reason, there has been considerable interest in predicting which students will succeed in online courses and which will receive poor grades or drop out prior to completion. Effective intervention depends on understanding which students are at risk in terms of actionable factors, and behavior within an online course is one key potential factor for intervention. In recent years, many have suggested that Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are a particularly useful place to conduct research into behavior and interventions, given both their size and the relatively low consequences and costs of experimentation. However, it is not yet clear whether the same factors are associated with student success in open courses, such as MOOCs, as in for-credit courses—an important consideration before transferring research results between these two contexts. While there has been considerable research in each context, differences between course design and population limit our ability to know how broadly findings generalize; differences between studies may have nothing to do with whether students are taking a course for credit or as a MOOC. Do learners behave the same way in MOOCs and for-credit courses? Are the implications for learning different, even for the same behaviors? In this paper, we study these issues through developing models that predict student course success from online interactions, in an online learning platform that caters to both distinct student groups (i.e., students who enroll on a for-credit or a noncredit basis). Our findings indicate that our models perform well enough to predict students’ course grades for new students across both of our populations. Furthermore, models trained on one of the two populations were able to generalize to new students in the other student population. We find that features related to comments were good predictors of student grades for both groups. Models generated from this research can now be used by instructors and course designers to identify at-risk students both for-credit and MOOC learners, with an eye toward providing both groups with better support. © 2018, The Online Learning Consortium.

The approach is grounded in the theory of constraints following the Decoding the Discipline model. The authors investigated a cognitive bottleneck involving problem modeling and an affective bottleneck concerning low self-efficacy of numeracy and designed specific interventions to address both bottlenecks simultaneously. The authors implemented the proposed approach in an introductory level analytics course in business operations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing deficiency in numeracy and problem-solving skills. Cognitive and affective learning interventions were introduced in an undergraduate core course in analytics. The perceived effectiveness of the interventions was evaluated with the use of a survey at the end of the course. To further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed interventions beyond self-reporting, the impact of the interventions on actual learning was evaluated by comparing the exam scores between classes with and without the interventions. Findings: Students who underwent the interventions successfully overcame both learning bottlenecks and indicated a positive change in attitude toward the analytics discipline as well as achieved higher exam scores in the analytics course. Research limitations/implications: This study succeeds in strengthening the body of research in teaching and learning. The authors also offer a holistic treatment of cognitive and affective learning bottlenecks, and provide empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed approach in elevating numeracy and problem-solving competencies of business undergraduates. Practical implications: The proposed approach is useful for business educators to improve business students’ quantitative modeling skill and attitude. Researchers can also extend the approach to other courses and settings to build up the body of research in learning and skill development. Educational policy makers may consider promoting promising approaches to improve students’ quantitative skill development. They can also set a high standard for higher education institutions to assess students’ numeracy and problem-solving competencies. Employers will find college graduates bring to their initial positions the high levels of numeracy and problem-solving skills demanded for knowledge work to sustain business growth and innovation. Social implications: As students’ numeracy and problem-solving skills are raised, they will develop an aptitude for quantitative-oriented coursework that equips them with the set of quantitative information-processing skills needed to succeed in the twenty-first century society and global economy. Originality/value: The proposed approach provides a goal-oriented three-step process to improve learning by overcoming learning bottlenecks as constraints of a learning process.

The authors propose enhanced machine learning (supervised learning) framework for the prediction of the students through stochastic probability-based math constructs/model and an algorithm [Good Fit Student (GFS)], along with the enhanced quantification of target variables and algorithmic metrics. Academia in today’s modern world sees the problem of dropouts, low retention, poor student performances, lack of motivation, and unnecessary change of study majors and re-admissions. The authors consider this challenge as a research problem and attempt to solve it by utilizing social networking-based personality traits, relevant data and features to improve the predictive modeling approach. The authors recognize that admission choices are often governed by family trends, affordability, basic motivation, market trends, and natural instincts. However, natural gifts and talents are minimally used to select such directions in the academics.

In part, this has led to a growing interest among education scientists and administrators in strategically mining and analyzing troves of data in order to uncover student behaviors and intervene in student life. As is the case in other contexts where actors are pursuing Big Data's supposed benefits, educational data mining is fraught with moral, ethical, and political conflict. The panel is composed of four researchers who analyze and critique educational data mining practices and learning analytics initiatives in particular micro-and macro-contexts, including academic libraries and professional advising, urban schools, graduate-level online learning, and higher education generally. Each panelist also represents a unique conceptual background, pulling from work in information ethics and policy, critical data studies, documentation studies, and higher education policy to empirically analyze and critically evaluate tools, systems, practices, policies, and values. Through their individual but thematically intertwined perspectives, the panelists will present their research and lead audience members in discussion.

In business circles, the same term connotes the level of consumer loyalty to a particular brand. This paper aims to extend the concept of “stickiness” not only to describe repeat return and commitment to the learning “product”, but also as a measure of the extent to which students are engaged in online learning opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores the efficacy of several approaches to the monitoring and measuring of online learning environments, and proposes a framework for assessing the extent to which these environments are compelling, engaging and “sticky”. Findings: In particular, the exploration so far has highlighted the difference between how lecturers have monitored the engagement of students in a face-to-face setting versus the online teaching environment. Practical implications: In the higher education environment where increasingly students are being asked to access learning in the online space, it is vital for teachers to be in a position to monitor and guide students in their engagement with online materials. Originality/value: The mere presence of learning materials online is not sufficient evidence of engagement.

We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze existing approaches, audiences, purposes, contexts, and data sources—both individually and in relation to one another—that designers and researchers have used to visualize educational data. Second, we examine how established literature in the fields of information visualization and education has been used to inform the design of visual learning analytics tools and to discuss research findings. We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories.

By 2012, 96% of general surgery residency programs subscribed to the SCORE web portal. Surgical educators have previously described the myriad ways they have incorporated SCORE into their curricula. The aim of this study was to analyze user data to describe how and when residents use SCORE. Methods Using analytic software, we measured SCORE usage from July, 2013 to June, 2016. Data such as IP addresses, geo-tagging coordinates, and operating system platforms were collected. The primary outcome was the median duration of SCORE use. Secondary outcomes were the time of day and the operating system used when accessing SCORE. Descriptive statistics were performed, and a p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results There were 42,743 total SCORE subscribers during the study period (75% resident and 25% faculty) with a mean of 14,248 subscribers per year. The overall median duration of SCORE use was 11.9 minute/session (interquartile range [IQR]: 6.8). Additionally, there was a significant increase in session length over the 3 academic years; 10.1 (IQR: 6.4), 11.9 (IQR: 7.2), and 13.2 minute/session (IQR: 5.4) in 2013 to 2014, 2014 to 2015, and 2015 to 2016, respectively (p < 0.001). SCORE usage was highest in November to February at 21.0 minute/session (14.2) compared to July to October and March to June (12.3 [IQR: 3.2] and 9.6 minute/session [IQR: 2.2]), respectively (p < 0.001). This seasonal trend continued for all 3 years. We observed an increased number of sessions per day over the 3 years: median of 1500 sessions/d (IQR: 1115) vs 1706 (IQR: 1334) vs 1728 (IQR: 1352), p < 0.001. (Fig.). Most SCORE sessions occurred at night: 38,011 (IQR: 4532) vs 17,529 (IQR: 19,850) during the day (p < 0.001). Windows was the most frequently used operating system at 48.9% (p < 0.001 vs others). Conclusions SCORE usage has increased significantly over the last 3 years, when measured by number of sessions per day and length of time per session. There are predictable daily, diurnal, and seasonal variations in SCORE usage. The annual in-training examination is a prominent factor stimulating SCORE usage. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","ABSITE; Medical Knowledge; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Professionalism; SCORE; study habits; surgery residents","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032217580"

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the latest developments and features of Smart LA by reviewing relevant cases. Design/methodology/approach: The paper studies several representative cases of Smart LA implementation, and highlights the key features of Smart LA. In addition, it discusses how instructors can use Smart LA to better understand the efforts their students make, and to improve learning experiences. Findings: Ongoing research in Smart LA involves testing across various learning domains, learning sensors and LA platforms. Through the collection, analysis and visualization of learner data and performance, instructors and learners gain more accurate understandings of individual learning behavior and ways to effectively address learner needs. As a result, students can make better decisions when refining their study plans (either by themselves or in collaboration with others), and instructors obtain a convenient monitor of student progress. In summary, Smart LA promotes self-regulated and/or co-regulated learning by discovering opportunities for remediation, and by prescribing materials and pedagogy for remedial instruction. Originality/value: Characteristically, Smart LA helps instructors give students effective and efficient learning experiences, by integrating the advanced learning analytics technology, fine-grained domain knowledge and locale-based information.

Despite this, research on factors leading to college-going choices do not yet utilize the extensive fine-grained data now becoming available on middle school learning and engagement. This paper uses interaction-based data-mined assessments of student behavior, academic emotions and knowledge from a middle school online learning environment, and evaluates their relationships with different outcomes in high school and college. The data-mined measures of student behavior, emotions, and knowledge are used in three analyses: (1) to develop a prediction model of college attendance; (2) to evaluate their relationships to intermediate outcomes on the path to college attendance such as math and science course-taking during high school; (3) to develop an overall path model between the educational experiences students have during middle school, their high school experiences, and their eventual college attendance. This gives a richer picture of the cognitive and non-cognitive mechanisms that students experience throughout varied phases in their years in school, and how they may be related to one another. Such understanding may provide educators with information about students’ trajectories within the college pipeline. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Academic emotion; Educational data mining; Educational technology; Engagement; Learning analytics; Middle school learning; Post-secondary outcomes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020743622"

This analysis was conducted in the first year of SI implementation within a traditionally high-challenge introductory psychology course.

In the Women's heart health study (WHHS), we developed Wanda-cardiovascular disease (CVD), where participants received healthy lifestyle education followed by six months of technology support and reinforcement. Wanda-CVD is a smartphone-based RHM system designed to assist participants in reducing identified CVD risk factors through wireless coaching using feedback and prompts as social support. Many participants benefitted from this RHM system. In response to the variance in participants' success, we developed a framework to identify classification schemes that predicted successful and unsuccessful participants. We analyzed both contextual baseline features and data from the first month of intervention such as activity, blood pressure, and questionnaire responses transmitted through the smartphone. A prediction tool can aid clinicians and scientists in identifying participants who may optimally benefit from the RHM system. Targeting therapies could potentially save healthcare costs, clinician, and participant time and resources. Our classification scheme yields RHM outcome success predictions with an F-measure of 91.9%, and identifies behaviors during the first month of intervention that help determine outcome success. We also show an improvement in prediction by using intervention-based smartphone data. Results from the WHHS study demonstrates that factors such as the variation in first month intervention response to the consumption of nuts, beans, and seeds in the diet help predict patient RHM protocol outcome success in a group of young Black women ages 25-45. © 2016 IEEE.","machine learning; outcome success; prediction and modeling; Remote health monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015802708"

By synthesizing components from the extensive biosurveillance literature, we propose a conceptual framework for a national biosurveillance architecture and provide suggestions for implementation. The framework differs from the current federal biosurveillance development pathway in that it is not focused on systems useful for ""situational awareness"" but is instead focused on the long-term goal of having true warning capabilities. Therefore, a guiding design objective is the ability to digitally detect emerging threats that span jurisdictional boundaries, because attempting to solve the most challenging biosurveillance problem first provides the strongest foundation to meet simpler surveillance objectives. Core components of the vision are: (1) a whole-of-government approach to support currently disparate federal surveillance efforts that have a common data need, including those for food safety, vaccine and medical product safety, and infectious disease surveillance; (2) an information architecture that enables secure national access to electronic health records, yet does not require that data be sent to a centralized location for surveillance analysis; (3) an inference architecture that leverages advances in ""big data"" analytics and learning inference engines - a significant departure from the statistical process control paradigm that underpins nearly all current syndromic surveillance systems; and (4) an organizational architecture with a governance model aimed at establishing national biosurveillance as a critical part of the US national infrastructure. Although it will take many years to implement, and a national campaign of education and debate to acquire public buy-in for such a comprehensive system, the potential benefits warrant increased consideration by the US government. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975506590"

How can we optimize the overall value? Aims: Critically appraise the value of online learning.; Methods: Narrative review.; Results: Several prevalent myths overinflate the value of online learning. These include that online learning is cheap and easy (it is usually more expensive), that it is more efficient (efficiency depends on the instructional design, not the modality), that it will transform education (fundamental learning principles have not changed), and that the Net Generation expects it (there is no evidence of pent-up demand). However, online learning does add real value by enhancing flexibility, control and analytics. Costs may also go down if disruptive innovations (e.g. low-cost, low-tech, but instructionally sound ""good enough"" online learning) supplant technically superior but more expensive online learning products. Cost-lowering strategies include focusing on core principles of learning rather than technologies, using easy-to-learn authoring tools, repurposing content (organizing and sequencing existing resources rather than creating new content) and using course templates.; Conclusions: Online learning represents just one tool in an educator's toolbox, as does the MRI for clinicians.

Recent studies have discounted the ability to predict student learning outcomes from big data analytics but a few significant indicators have been found by some researchers. Current studies tend to use quantitative factors in learning analytics to forecast outcomes. This study extends that work by testing the common quantitative predictors of learning outcome, but qualitative data is also examined to triangulate the evidence. Pre and post testing of information technology understanding is done at the beginning of the course. First quantitative data is collected, and depending on the hypothesis test results, qualitative data is collected and analyzed with text analytics to uncover patterns. Moodle engagement analytics indicators are tested as predictors in the model. Data is also taken from the Moodle system logs. Qualitative data is collected from student reflection essays.

The high attrition rates associated with MOOCs have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with MOOCs and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.","Algorithm; Dropout; Learning analytics; MOOC; Prediction; Stacking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952895313"

The highly vulnerable population included 155 disadvantaged, high-risk parents (e.g., 76% had a family annual income of less than $15,000; 41% had been incarcerated; 38% were in drug/alcohol treatment; and 24% had had a child removed due to maltreatment). The ethnic groups most commonly identified were African American (24%) and Hispanic (66%). Respondents were primarily mothers (86%) from five community programs in Los Angeles. The study used a single group repeated measures design (pre, post, 6-month follow-up). Data collected included standardized self-report measures, post-intervention focus groups and interviews, website usage reports, and Google Analytics. Significant multivariate ANOVA time effects were found, demonstrating reductions in child behavioral problems, reduced lax/permissive and over-reactive parenting, and decreased parental stress. No effects were found for parental confidence, attributions, or depression and anxiety (which were in the normal range at baseline). Positive effects were maintained or improved at 6-month follow-up. The participants engaged in the online community and valued its flexibility, anonymity, and shared learning. This foundational implementation trial provides support for future rigorous evaluation of social media and gaming features as a medium for increasing parental engagement in evidence-based parenting programs online-a public health approach to protect and improve the development of vulnerable children. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Effective parenting; Evidence-based programs; Online interventions; Social media; Triple P","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957403087"

Stakeholders in LA are students, educators, researchers, institutions, and government agencies. The way in which analytics information flows from students to other stakeholders involves a hierarchy, where all stakeholders are able to provide input and offer recommendations to enrich the learning process for the student. Challenges faced by stakeholders include the movement of traditional analytics to learner-centered analytics, working with datasets across various settings, addressing issues with technology and resolving ethical concerns.

The ability to efficiently proctor remote online examinations is an important limiting factor to the scalability of this next stage in education. Presently, human proctoring is the most common approach of evaluation, by either requiring the test taker to visit an examination center, or by monitoring them visually and acoustically during exams via a webcam. However, such methods are labor intensive and costly. In this paper, we present a multimedia analytics system that performs automatic online exam proctoring. The system hardware includes one webcam, one wearcam, and a microphone for the purpose of monitoring the visual and acoustic environment of the testing location. The system includes six basic components that continuously estimate the key behavior cues: user verification, text detection, voice detection, active window detection, gaze estimation, and phone detection. By combining the continuous estimation components, and applying a temporal sliding window, we design higher level features to classify whether the test taker is cheating at any moment during the exam. To evaluate our proposed system, we collect multimedia (audio and visual) data from 24 subjects performing various types of cheating while taking online exams. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our online exam proctoring system. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Covariance feature; gaze estimation; online exam proctoring (OEP); phone detection; speech detection; text detection; user verification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021323599"

The insights gained from the analyses of these large amounts of data are only helpful to the extent that they can be the basis for positive action such as knowledge discovery, improved capacity for prediction, and anomaly detection. Big Data involves the aggregation and melding of large and heterogeneous datasets while education analytics involves looking for patterns in educational practice or performance in single or aggregate datasets. Although it seems likely that the use of education analytics and Big Data techniques will have a transformative impact on health professional education, there is much yet to be done before they can become part of mainstream health professional education practice. If health professional education is to be accountable for its programs run and are developed, then health professional educators will need to be ready to deal with the complex and compelling dynamics of analytics and Big Data.

The VLAT consists of 12 data visualizations and 53 multiple-choice test items that cover eight data visualization tasks. The test items in the VLAT were evaluated with respect to their essentialness by five domain experts in Information Visualization and Visual Analytics (average content validity ratio = 0.66). The VLAT was also tried out on a sample of 191 test takers and showed high reliability (reliability coefficient omega = 0.76). In addition, we demonstrated the relationship between users' visualization literacy and aptitude for learning an unfamiliar visualization and showed that they had a fairly high positive relationship (correlation coefficient = 0.64). Finally, we discuss evidence for the validity of the VLAT and potential research areas that are related to the instrument. © 2016 IEEE.","Aptitude; Assessment Test; Education; Instrument; Measurement; Visualization Literacy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999233581"

In this position paper, we explore the impact of several such advances in HCI on the design of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), with the hypothesis that such systems may drive deeper engagement and hence improve learning outcomes. Researchers have made claims regarding learning gains resulting from self-explanations, frequent addressing of errors and impasses, rich natural language understanding and dialog, appropriate degree of interactivity, and use of multiple representations. However, many studies on current ITSs that have embodied one or more of the above features are showing little to no discernible impact on learning. This is possibly partly due to the poor user experience. Our tutoring system is aimed at addressing learning challenges for K-12 students, by integrating a suite of differentiating technologies around interactivity, dialog, automated question generation, and learning analytics. In this paper, we first review learning theories and insights gleaned from prior research on ITSs that have inspired our design. We then describe the functional architecture of our tutoring system, followed by a preliminary report on the status of the prototype currently being built. © 2015 IBM.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969834010"

One of the most profitable learning techniques, “Learning from the crowd,” or augmenting “collective intelligence,” has attracted the attention of several learners who seek information in terms of knowledge access. This provides an admirable environment for learning with peers rather than learning alone. However, having access to these online learning technologies does not simply give the users the chance to optimize learning. In addition, researchers have expressed ethical concerns related to issues like accessibility, quality, authenticity, and reliability of content. Taking into consideration the pluses and minuses of “crowdsourced learning,” each of the panelists in this program will shed light on how to use the “wisdom of crowds” or “collective intelligence” to better articulate the process of learning in context of such ethical issues. Each of the panelists comes from a different field of expertise (Information Science, Library Science, e-Learning, Learning Analytics, and Education). This diversity of experience will be reflected in the different perspectives presented in the area of crowdsourcing in education. The session will conclude with the panelists' presentation of significant comments that would emerge in the discussion.

The problem is that the rapid embrace of of LA diverts educators’ attention from clearly identifying requirements and implications of using LA in higher education. LA is a promising emerging field, yet higher education stakeholders need to become further familiar with issues related to the use of LA in higher education. Few studies have synthesized previous studies to provide an overview of LA issues in higher education. To address the problem, a systemic literature review was conducted to provide an overview of methods, benefits, and challenges of using LA in higher education. The literature review revealed that LA uses various methods including visual data analysis techniques, social network analysis, semantic, and educational data mining including prediction, clustering, relationship mining, discovery with models, and separation of data for human judgment to analyze data. The benefits include targeted course offerings, curriculum development, student learning outcomes, behavior and process, personalized learning, improved instructor performance, post-educational employment opportunities, and enhanced research in the field of education. Challenges include issues related to data tracking, collection, evaluation, analysis; lack of connection to learning sciences; optimizing learning environments, and ethical and privacy issues. Such a comprehensive overview provides an integrative report for faculty, course developers, and administrators about methods, benefits, and challenges of LA so that they may apply LA more effectively to improve teaching and learning in higher education. © 2016 Online Learning Consortium.

We examined 22 upper level undergraduates in a genomics course as they engaged in a case-based inquiry with an interactive heat map. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed students’ visual analytic behaviors, reasoning and outcomes to identify student performance patterns, commonly shared efficiencies and task completion. We analyzed students’ successes and difficulties in applying knowledge and skills relevant to the visual analytics case and related gaps in knowledge and skill to associated tool designs. Findings show that undergraduate engagement in visual analytics is feasible and could be further strengthened through tool usability improvements. We identify these improvements.

This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with EDM has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest GBLA shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer-based assessment; Educational data mining; Game-based learning; Implicit science learning; Learning analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018450823"

In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use ""and,"" ""or,"" and ""not"" statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners' programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation. © 2017 ACM.","Collaborative learning; Computer science education; Computer supported collaborative learning; Educational data mining; Equity; Learning analytics; Social networking forums; Social networking sites","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028586628"

The goal of MRI was to mobilize researchers to engage into critical interrogation of MOOCs. The submissions - 266 in Phase 1, out of which 78 was recommended for resubmission in the extended form in Phase 2, and finally, 28 funded - were analyzed by applying conventional and automated content analysis methods as well as citation network analysis methods. The results revealed the main research themes that could form a framework of the future MOOC research: i) student engagement and learning success, ii) MOOC design and curriculum, iii) self-regulated learning and social learning, iv) social network analysis and networked learning, and v) motivation, attitude and success criteria. The theme of social learning received the greatest interest and had the highest success in attracting funding. The submissions that planned on using learning analytics methods were more successful. The use of mixed methods was by far the most popular. Design-based research methods were also suggested commonly, but the questions about their applicability arose regarding the feasibility to perform multiple iterations in the MOOC context and rather a limited focus on technological support for interventions. The submissions were dominated by the researchers from the field of education (75% of the accepted proposals). Not only was this a possible cause of a complete lack of success of the educational technology innovation theme, but it could be a worrying sign of the fragmentation in the research community and the need to increased efforts towards enhancing interdisciplinarity. © Gašević, Kovanović, Joksimović, Siemens.","Content analysis; Education research; Massive online open courses; MOOC; MOOC research analysis; MOOC research initiative","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908653189"

With the rapidly expanding collection and availability of learning data and related analytics, student performance can be accurately monitored, and possibly predicted ahead of time, thus, enabling early warning and degree planning 'expert systems' to provide disciplined decision support to counselors, advisors, and educators. Previous work in educational data mining has explored matrix factorization techniques for grade prediction, albeit without taking contextual information into account. Temporal information should be informative as it distinguishes between the different class offerings and indirectly captures student experience as well. To exploit temporal and/or other kinds of context, we develop three approaches under the framework of collaborative filtering (CF). Two of the proposed approaches build upon coupled matrix factorization with a shared latent matrix factor. The third utilizes tensor factorization to model grades and their context, without introducing a new mode per context dimension as is common in the CF literature. The latent factors obtained can be used to predict grades and context, if desired. We evaluate these approaches on grade data obtained from the University of Minnesota. Experimental results show that fairly good prediction is possible even with simple approaches, but very accurate prediction is hard. The more advanced approaches can increase prediction accuracy, but only up to a point for the particular dataset considered. © 2017 IEEE.","Alternating optimization; candecomp/parafac (CP) decomposition; collaborative filtering; coupled matrix factorization; matrix/tensor rank; predicting student performance; singular value decomposition (SVD); tensor factorization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029478679"

The study was informed by archival (de-identified) data gathered in the United Kingdom from students in an online education setting, which bears many similarities to American online higher education: namely, non-traditional student demographics, open enrollment, and a completely online education structure. A series of logistic regressions yielded two findings. First, the only statistically significant predictor of student success is the number of course attempts. Therefore, since number of attempts is a more statistically significant predictor of student completion than student demographics, understanding what influences how many course attempts students need in order to be successful can be more useful for targeted educational policy making. Second, for those who only required one attempt to be successful, the number of previously studied credits was the only significant predictor. For those who required more than one course attempt, age was also a significant predictor. Thus, the number of credits students had prior to taking an online course is a useful predictor of whether a student is successful the first time they attempt an online learning module. For those who seem to need numerous attempts before being successful, age seems to be more of a statistically significant predictor than any other demographic factor. © Common Ground Research Networks, M.

This is addressed through our study of an online engineering community that serves 31,219 engineering learners who contributed 503,908 messages in 65,209 topics. The guiding theoretical framework is the knowledge creation metaphor, which conceptualizes learning as a collaborative process of developing shared knowledge artifacts for the collective benefit of a community of learners. The aims of this study are twofold: (1) to analyze the state of knowledge creation in the community; and (2) to evaluate the strength of association between proposed analytics and variables indicative of knowledge creation in online environments. Findings suggest that the community is vibrant as a whole but also reveal disparity in participation at the individual level. At the topic-level, knowledge creation activities are strongly associated with Topic Length and moderately associated with Topic Duration. At the individual-level, participation in knowledge creation activities is strongly associated with Individual Total Interactions and weakly associated with Individual Total Membership Period. The implications of the findings are discussed and may provide guidance for educators seeking to adopt learning analytics in online communities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Engineering education; Knowledge creation; Learning analytics; Learning communities","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019068885"

However, employing CNN for classification of graphs remains to be challenging. This paper presents the Ngram graph-block based convolutional neural network model for classification of graphs. Our Ngram deep learning framework consists of three novel components. First, we introduce the concept of $n$ -gram block to transform each raw graph object into a sequence of $n$ -gram blocks connected through overlapping regions. Second, we introduce a diagonal convolution step to extract local patterns and connectivity features hidden in these $n$ -gram blocks by performing $n$ -gram normalization. Finally, we develop deeper global patterns based on the local patterns and the ways that they respond to overlapping regions by building a $n$ -gram deep learning model using convolutional neural network. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it with the existing state of art methods using five real graph repositories from bioinformatics and social networks domains. Our results show that the Ngram approach outperforms existing methods with high accuracy and comparable performance. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Classification of graphs; Convolutional neural network; N-gram modeling; Subgraph pattern extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021962588"

It is termed CAMEO – Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (>50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Academic dishonesty; Educational data mining; Learning analytics; MOOCs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013224880"

The move away from traditional paper-based course materials, registration, admissions and support services to the mobile, always-on and always accessible data has driven demand for information and generated new forms of data observable through consumption behaviours. These changes have led to a plethora of data sets that store learning content and track user behaviours. Most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. This paper proposes a foundational learning analytics model (LAM) for higher education that focuses on the dynamic interaction of stakeholders with their data supported by visual analytics, such as self-organising maps, to generate conversations, shared inquiry and solution-seeking. The model can be applied for other educational institutions interested in using learning analytics processes to support personalised learning and support services.

The benefits of adaptive learning to achieve personalized learning are obvious. Yet, there lacks evidence-based research to understand how data such as user behavior patterns can be used to design effective adaptive learning systems. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to investigate what behavior patterns learners with different characteristics demonstrate when they interact with an adaptive learning environment. Incoming 1st-year students in a pharmacy professional degree program engaged in an adaptive learning intervention that aimed to provide remedial instruction to better prepare these professional students before they began their formal degree program. We analyzed the participants’ behavior patterns through the usage data to understand how they used the adaptive system based upon their needs and interests. Using both statistical analyses and data visualization techniques, this study found: (1) apart from learners’ cognitive ability, it is important to consider affective factors such as motivation in adaptive learning, (2) lack of alignment among various components in an adaptive system can impact how learners accessed the system and, more importantly, their performance, and (3) visualizations can reveal interesting findings that can be missed otherwise. Such research should provide much needed empirical evidences and useful insights about how the analytics can inform the effective designs of adaptive learning. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptive learning; Data visualization; Learning analytics; Personalized learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85024495665"

The study resulted in two findings: Three types of KSIs emerged: whole group, between individual, and smaller, nested affinity groups; and GCLR emerged as a distinct online community with unique social practices. KSIs generated and supported collaborative opportunities to exchange ideas, co-construct knowledge, offer practical classroom applications, and gain insight about important critical literacy issues. As an online networked space that brings together participants interested in critical literacy issues, GCLR represents an innovative type of situated practice with an aim to develop what we call online Networked Spaces of Praxis (oNSP). ï¿½ The Author(s) 2016.","Communities of practice; Critical literacy; Knowledge sharing; Literacy; Nested affinity groups; Nested affinity spaces; Online learning; Online spaces; Open education pedagogy; Open education resources; Praxis; Professional development; Web seminars","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991712521"

Research on reform implementation highlights how individual decision-making is shaped by a variety of inter-connected factors - or what we call 'decision chains’. Organizational learning theory offers a way to conceptualize how these decision chains are implicated in the change process. Organizational learning refers to the processes whereby organizations store information in what is known as the ‘organizational memory’, how this information is retrieved, and how alterations to these processes can affect organizational. In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative case study of how 24 science and math faculty at a large, public research university in the United States engaged with their organization’s memory while planning courses. We also explore how a reform initiative—the Undergraduate Science Education (USE) project—influenced these memory functions. We analyzed semi-structured interviews using a structured approach to grounded theory as well as techniques for graphically depicting verbal data. Results: Results indicate that faculty accessed five repositories of curricular information within the organizational memory: individual memory, cultural norms, social networks and human resources, curricular artifacts, and external archives. When retrieving information from these repositories, faculty primarily ‘fine-tuned’ existing curricular artifacts (i.e., lecture notes and PowerPoint slides). Analyses of decision chains used by faculty highlight the idiosyncratic manner in which planning unfolds in practice, the centrality of existing artifacts, the role of contextual factors, and the absence of continuous improvement systems. Analyses of the USE project’s effects indicate changes to features of the organizational memory. Conclusions: Besides contributing new insights into the nature of organizational learning in higher education, the decision chain method described in this paper can be used to complement existing metrics for program evaluation and to diagnose leverage points for new STEM education change efforts. A potentially useful approach may target curricular artifacts for regular updating and the imposition of continuous improvement systems, while allowing faculty local control over this process. © 2014, Hora and Hunter; licensee Springer.","Decision-making; Education reform; Organizational analytics; Organizational learning; Postsecondary teaching; STEM education","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051833558"

The millennial generation's learning preferences also force us to reconsider how to reach physicians in training. Social media is emerging as a viable tool for advancing curricula in graduate medical education. Objective: The authors sought to understand how social media enhances a residency program's educational mission. Methods: While chief residents in the 2013-2014 academic year, two of the authors (PB, AN) maintained a Twitter feed for their academic internal medicine residency program. Participants included the chief residents and categorical internal medicine house staff. Results: At the year's end, the authors surveyed residents about uses and attitudes toward this initiative. Residents generally found the chief residents' tweets informative, and most residents (42/61, 69%) agreed that Twitter enhanced their overall education in residency. Conclusions: Data from this single-site intervention corroborate that Twitter can strengthen a residency program's educational mission. The program's robust following on Twitter outside of the home program also suggests a need for wider adoption of social media in graduate medical education. Improved use of data analytics and dissemination of these practices to other programs would lend additional insight into social media's role in improving residents' educational experiences. © Paul A Bergl, Akhil Narang, Vineet M Arora.

We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.","Autonomy; higher education; information ethics; information privacy; learning analytics; student privacy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957795176"

However, understanding how students learn these complex skills in a game environment is a challenge, as much research uses typical paper-and-pencil assessments and self-reported surveys or other traditional observational and quantitative methods. The purpose of this study is to identify students' learning behavior patterns of problem-solving and explore behavior patterns of different performing groups within an open-ended serious game called Alien Rescue. To accomplish this purpose, this study intends to use gameplay data by incorporating sequential pattern mining and statistical analysis. The findings of this study confirmed the results from previous research (using ex situ data such as interviews) and at the same time provide an analytical approach to understand in-depth students' sequential behavior patterns using in situ gameplay data. This study examined the frequent sequential patterns between low- and high-performing students and showed that problem-solving strategies were different between these two performing groups. By using this integrated analytical method, we can gain a better understanding of the learning pathway of students’ performance and problem-solving strategies of students with different learning characteristics in a serious games context. © 2016","Learning behavior; Learning process; Middle school science; Pattern mining; Problem-solving; Serious games analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85005842145"

This has led to increased interest in the field of learning analytics, which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of IDE-based learning analytics. In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1) Collect data, (2) Analyze data, (3) Design intervention, and (4) Deliver intervention. For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing effective interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics. © 2017 ACM.","Learning analytics; Learning interventions; Learning process data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028590656"

Despite marked progress in some places driven by these improvement efforts, overall progress in the education field has been slow and outcomes remain highly variable. This is partly because the field is not organized to learn systematically, accumulate, and disseminate the practical knowledge needed for the improvement of teaching and learning. Purpose/Objective: This paper explores the initiation of a social structure to organize collaborative improvement work: The networked improvement community (or NIC). NICs are highly structured, intentionally formed collaborations among education professionals, researchers, and designers that aim to address a high leverage practical problem. We focus on NIC initiation, because of the challenges associated with launching improvement networks.Research Design: Drawing on analysis of case studies of network initiation and theory on network initiation and the NIC concept, we posit an organizing framework for describing the process of NIC initiation. Findings/Results: The NIC initiation framework specifies five domains of activity that we hypothesize are critical to launching a NIC. These domains attend to: Developing a theory of practice improvement; building a measurement and analytics infrastructure; learning and using improvement research methods; leading, organizing, and operating the network; and fostering the emergence of culture, norms, and identity consistent with network aims. We illustrate these five domains with examples from a set of case studies of network initiation that we utilized as a way to test and further elaborate the framework. Conclusions/Recommendations: A firm foundation for network initiation is laid through the strategic actions of a network initiation team. By attending to the five domains of activity specified in our framework, initiation teams can catalyze the development of an organizational structure that allows educators to accelerate learning from practice and building a professional knowledge base that enables the field to tackle complex educational problems. © 2017.

Reports include strategic plans to overcome challenges to OCW creation and implementation, the project's growth and maturation, overall use of OCW, and possible future directions. As a result of its 5-year development and of lessons learned, the NTU-OCW experience features: (1) integrating resources on campus and established operating procedures, (2) setting course selection criteria featuring the strength of NTU and Taiwan, (3) providing coherent program support to enhance faculty participation, and (4) adhering strictly to the Creative Commons license. Data from Google Analytics was reviewed for better understanding of the use, characteristics, course preferences, and behaviors of NTU-OCW users. Results show visitors were primarily lifelong learners (65%) in informal learning settings.

Previous research using self-report or laboratory measures of reading show that engagement with the textbook was related to student learning outcomes. We hypothesized that an engagement index based on digital textbook usage data would predict student course grades. Linear regression analyses were conducted using data from 233 students to determine whether digital textbook usage metrics predicted final course grades. A calculated linear index of textbook usage metrics was significantly predictive of final course grades and was a stronger predictor of course outcomes than previous academic achievement. However, time spent reading, one of the variables that make up the index was more strongly predictive of course outcomes. Additionally, students who were in the top 10th percentile in number of highlights had significantly higher course grades than those in the lower 90th percentile. These findings suggest that digital textbook analytics are an effective early warning system to identify students at risk of academic failure. These data can be collected unobtrusively and automatically and provide stronger prediction of outcomes than prior academic achievement (which to this point has been the single strongest predictor of student success). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are few if any Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited programs that are completely online. Not only is there a need for innovative approaches and an ability to offer laboratory courses online, but there is a parallel need for assessment tools that allow the collection and analysis of course outcomes and objectives, in a seamless manner. A web-based assessment system might have more potential in terms of access and flexibility for teachers and administrators in terms of overall effectiveness and efficiency of producing “Learning Analytics” [2]. The philosophy driving the approach in this work is to allow the instructor to focus on course outcomes via embedded problems and laboratory exercises while the program outcomes are derived from a mapping between the two levels. Subsequently, examining performance metrics and taking a proper course of action are conveniently done at all levels of administration. In this paper, we will present assessment results of online course student learning outcomes using a performance assessment framework (PAF) or (Searchlight Performance Assessment™), which was developed with feedback from our institution.

However, in the education of health care professionals, the application of BD/LA is limited to date. The authors discuss the potential advantages of the BD/LA approach for the process of learning via cognitive simulations. Using the lens of a cognitive model of radiograph interpretation with four phases (orientation, searching/scanning, feature detection, and decision making), they reanalyzed process data from a cognitive simulation of pediatric ankle radiography where 46 practitioners from three expertise levels classified 234 cases online. To illustrate the big data component, they highlight the data available in a digital environment (time-stamped, click-level process data). Learning analytics were illustrated using algorithmic computer-enabled approaches to process-level feedback. For each phase, the authors were able to identify examples of potentially useful BD/LA measures. For orientation, the trackable behavior of re-reviewing the clinical history was associated with increased diagnostic accuracy. For searching/scanning, evidence of skipping views was associated with an increased false-negative rate. For feature detection, heat maps overlaid on the radiograph can provide a metacognitive visualization of common novice errors. For decision making, the measured influence of sequence effects can reflect susceptibility to bias, whereas computer-generated path maps can provide insights into learners' diagnostic strategies. In conclusion, the augmented collection and dynamic analysis of learning process data within a cognitive simulation can improve feedback and prompt more precise reflection on a novice clinician's skill development. © 2016 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969921770"

As digitally-based games become increasingly prevalent in both formal and informal learning environments, robust research and assessment vehicles within well-designed games become vital. A central challenge with this video games research in education is to demonstrate evidence of player learning. Rather than ignore the motivating and information-rich features of games in capturing learning, assessment designers need to attend to the ways in which game-play itself can provide a powerful new form of assessment. This requires learning researchers to think of games as both intervention and assessment; and to develop methods for using the internal structures of games as paths for evidence generation to document learning. ADAGE consists of two main layers: 1) the semantic template that determines which click-stream data events could be indicators of learning; 2) the learning telemetry that captures data for analysis. This study highlights how ADAGE was implemented in science game to provide a wealth of in-game player data indicative of both gameplay and learning progress to reveal important relationships between kinds of success, failure and learning in the game. © Copyright 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","ADAGE; Digital media and learning; Educational data mining; Educational games; Embedded assessment; Evidence centred design; Game-based assessment; Game-based learning; Learning analytics; Technology-based assessment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928478783"

Performance prediction is particularly challenging in MOOC settings due to per-student assessment response sparsity and the need for personalized models. Our method overcomes these challenges by incorporating another, richer form of data collected from each student - lecture video-watching clickstreams - into the machine learning feature set, and using that to train a time series neural network that learns from both prior performance and clickstream data. Through evaluation on two MOOC datasets, we find that our algorithm outperforms a baseline of average past performance by more than 60% on average, and a lasso regression baseline by more than 15%. Moreover, the gains are higher when the student has answered fewer questions, underscoring their ability to provide instructors with early detection of struggling and/or advanced students. We also show that despite these gains, when taken alone, none of the behavioral features are particularly correlated with performance, emphasizing the need to consider their combined effect and nonlinear predictors.

The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students' chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains.

While some universities have started to use standards-based grading, which has educational advantages over common score-based grading, at–risk prediction models have not been adapted to reap the benefits of standards-based grading in courses that utilize this grading. In this paper, we compare predictive methods to identify at-risk students in a course that used standards-based grading. Only in-semester performance data that were available to the course instructors were used in the prediction methods. When identifying at-risk students, it is important to minimize false negative (i.e., type II) error while not increasing false positive (i.e., type I) error significantly. To increase the generalizability of the models and accuracy of the predictions, we used a feature selection method to reduce the number of variables used in each model. The Naive Bayes Classifier model and an Ensemble model using a sequence of models (i.e., Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes Classifier) had the best results among the seven tested modeling methods. © 2016 The Authors","First-year engineering; Learning analytics; Predictive modeling; Standards-based grading; Students success","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988526942"

After a systematic literature search, I conducted a meta-analysis synthesizing 56 articles containing 66 separate experiments and quasi-experiments and 83 treatment arms. I evaluated 12 types of education interventions such as the provision of school supplies, the use of teacher incentives, and school-based management programs. I examine each intervention type, present analytics on relative effectiveness, and explore why certain interventions seem to be more effective. A key finding is that programs that alter teacher pedagogy or classroom instructional techniques had an effect size approximately 0.30 standard deviations greater than all other types of programs combined. Limited evidence further suggests that pedagogical programs that employed adaptive instruction or teacher coaching were particularly effective. Given that the literature in the field is still nascent overall, these results advocate for further research into these pedagogical interventions. © 2017, © 2017 AERA.","education and developing countries; impact evaluation; meta-analysis; randomized experiment; Sub-Saharan Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028966448"

There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students' learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students' CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students' programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments.

To realize these aims, we are developing and implementing a mobile app with two parts: (1) a front-end virtual scientist called Dr. Discovery (Dr. D) for use by museum visitors that doubles as an unobtrusive data-gatherer and (2) a back-end analytics portal to be mined by museum staff, evaluators, and researchers. With the aid of our museum partners, we are developing this app to function as a platform for STEM informal education, research, and data-driven decision-making by museum staff. The Dr. D app has been designed to engage museum visitors, while connecting with an analytic system to make sense, in real time, of the large amounts of data produced by visitors’ use of the app. The analytic system helps museum staff access and interpret ongoing evaluation data, regardless of experience or museum resources, informing the practice of professionals at the front lines of informal STEM education in diverse communities. The design of the Dr. D app incorporates open-source analytic tools that make the gathering and interpretation of contextual information from visitors’ app use accessible to museum staff and educators, building their capacity for using data in their day-to-day work.

Following such calls, this article conceptualizes ''learning analytics'' as an assemblage of technical, designed, and sociocognitive dimensions. Drawing on DeLanda's articulation of assemblage theory, we examine the ways online learning unfolds within and across these scales by using illustrative quantitative and qualitative data-click-data, user-generated content, and student interviews-from three online higher education courses. We consider how insights generated from such a stance might contribute to critical perspectives on how power circulates in online learning environments-A framework we call ''critical learning analytics.''

These courses have attracted millions of learners recently. At present, most MOOC platforms record the web log data of learner interactions with course videos. Such large amounts of multivariate data pose a new challenge in terms of analyzing online learning behaviors. Previous studies have mainly focused on the aggregate behaviors of learners from a summative view; however, few attempts have been made to conduct a detailed analysis of such behaviors. To determine complex learning patterns in MOOC video interactions, this paper introduces a comprehensive visualization system called PeakVizor. This system enables course instructors and education experts to analyze the 'peaks' or the video segments that generate numerous clickstreams. The system features three views at different levels: the overview with glyphs to display valuable statistics regarding the peaks detected; the flow view to present spatio-temporal information regarding the peaks; and the correlation view to show the correlation between different learner groups and the peaks. Case studies and interviews conducted with domain experts have demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of PeakVizor, and new findings about learning behaviors in MOOC platforms have been reported. © 2016 IEEE.","clickstream data; MOOC; online education; visual analytics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985911944"

In prior research, we explored the relationship between (a) students' programming behaviors and course outcomes, and (b) students' participation within an online social learning environment and course outcomes. In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students' course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide signifficantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success. © 2017 ACM.","Learning analytics; Learning interventions; Learning process data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028588277"

Most current prediction models are difficult for teachers to interpret. This poses significant problems for model use (e.g. personalizing education and intervention) as well as model evaluation. In this paper, we synthesize learning analytics approaches, educational data mining (EDM) and HCI theory to explore the development of more usable prediction models and prediction model representations using data from a collaborative geometry problem solving environment: Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG). First, based on theory proposed by Hrastinski (2009) establishing online learning as online participation, we operationalized activity theory to holistically quantify students' participation in the CSCL (Computer-supported Collaborative Learning) course. As a result, 6 variables, Subject, Rules, Tools, Division of Labor, Community, and Object, are constructed. This analysis of variables prior to the application of a model distinguishes our approach from prior approaches (feature selection, Ad-hoc guesswork etc.). The approach described diminishes data dimensionality and systematically contextualizes data in a semantic background. Secondly, an advanced modeling technique, Genetic Programming (GP), underlies the developed prediction model. We demonstrate how connecting the structure of VMTwG trace data to a theoretical framework and processing that data using the GP algorithmic approach outperforms traditional models in prediction rate and interpretability. Theoretical and practical implications are then discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While empirical studies on gamification in higher education are showing modest gains in some areas, this data can be difficult to interpret because of the many ways that gamification can be designed and implemented. Gamification is also controversial for appearing exploitative, seeming oversimplified, and having the tendency to rely on extrinsic motivation and learning analytics that may not translate to student learning. This paper provides a brief overview of gamification in higher education and looks at findings from recent empirical studies. It then examines its key criticisms as well as its potential contributions to improving instructional design in higher education. A practical example and a set of recommendations are provided to show how instructors new to gamification and interested in implementing it can adapt it for their courses.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020689516"

Existing data from two sections of an online pre-service teacher education courses from a Southeastern university were analyzed for this study. Both courses were taught by the same instructor in a 15 weeks time period. One section was designed with the adaptive release feature for content release and the other did not have the adaptive release feature. All other elements of the course were the same. Data from five interaction measures was analyzed (logins, total time spent, average time per session, content modules accessed, time between module open and access) to explore the effect of the adaptive release feature. The findings indicated that there was a significant difference between the use of adaptive release and average login session. Considered as the average time of module access across the entire course, adaptive release did not systematically change when students accessed course materials. The findings also indicated significant differences between the experimental and control courses, especially for the first course module.

We first conceptualize small group learning as a complex system and explain how group dynamics and interaction can be modeled via theoretically grounded, simple rules. These rules are then operationalized to build temporally-embodied measures, where varying weights are assigned to the same measures according to their significance during different time stages based on the golden ratio concept. This theory-based measure construction method in combination with a correlation-based feature subset selection algorithm reduces data dimensionality, making a complex system more understandable for people. Further, because the discipline of education often generates small datasets, a Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes classifier was coded to develop an assessment model, which achieves the highest accuracy (95.8%) as compared to baseline models. Finally, we describe a web-based tool that visualizes time-series activities, assesses small group learning automatically, and also offers actionable intelligence for teachers to provide real-time support and intervention to students. The fundamental contribution of this paper is that it makes complex, small group behavior visible to teachers in a learning context quickly.

Four unique subtypes were identified. Approximately 50% of the courses manifested inactive utilization of LMS or immature stage of blended learning implementation, which is labeled as Type I. Other subtypes included Type C - Communication or Collaboration (24.3%), Type D - Delivery or Discussion (18.0%), and Type S - Sharing or Submission (7.2%). We discussed the implications of BL based on data-driven decisions to provide strategic institutional initiatives. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Increasingly, this means providing students information in online classrooms to help them reach their highest potential. The acts of teaching and learning online generate data, but to date, that information has remained largely untapped for assessing student performance. Using data generated by students in an online Master of Public Administration program, drawn from the Marist College Open Academic Analytics Initiative,1 we identify and analyze characteristics and behaviors that best provide early indication of a student being academically at risk, paying particular attention to the usage of online tools. We find that fairly simple learning analytics models achieve high levels of sensitivity (over 80% of at-risk students identified) with relatively low false positive rates (13.5%).

This article puts aside separate unresolved - and perhaps unresolvable - issues regarding the concrete effects of specific technologies. It instead examines how big data-driven tools alter the structure of schools' pedagogical decision-making, and, in doing so, change fundamental aspects of America's education enterprise. Technological mediation and data-driven decision-making have a particularly significant impact in learning environments because the education process primarily consists of dynamic information exchange. In this overview, I highlight three significant structural shifts that accompany school reliance on data-driven instructional platforms that perform core school functions: teaching, assessment, and credentialing. First, virtual learning environments create information technology infrastructures featuring constant data collection, continuous algorithmic assessment, and possibly infinite record retention. This undermines the traditional intellectual privacy and safety of classrooms. Second, these systems displace pedagogical decision-making from educators serving public interests to private, often for-profit, technology providers. They constrain teachers' academic autonomy, obscure student evaluation, and reduce parents' and students' ability to participate or challenge education decision-making. Third, big data-driven tools define what ""counts"" as education by mapping the concepts, creating the content, determining the metrics, and setting desired learning outcomes of instruction. These shifts cede important decision-making to private entities without public scrutiny or pedagogical examination. In contrast to the public and heated debates that accompany textbook choices, schools often adopt education technologies ad hoc. Given education's crucial impact on individual and collective success, educators and policymakers must consider the implications of data-driven education proactively and explicitly. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","big data; competency-based education; learning analytics; MOOCs; personalized learning; smart tutors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021153252"

While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role of personalized learning technology in the corporatization of public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers, and published research monographs, this paper details how big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy, teaching, and learning in ways that transfer educational decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making, and a narrow conception of learning as the acquisition of discrete skills and behavior modification detached from broader social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes by drawing out the contradictions inherent to personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","big data; corporatization; educational technology; Personalized learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954228990"

If they are to meet these challenges, dental schools must develop a research and discovery mission that will equip graduates with the new knowledge required to function in a modern health care environment. The dental practitioner of 2040 will place greater emphasis on risk assessment, disease prevention, and health maintenance; and the emerging discipline of precision medicine and systems biology will revolutionize disease diagnosis and reveal new targeted therapies. The dental graduate of 2040 will be expected to function effectively in a collaborative, learning health care system and to understand the impact of health care policy on local, national, and global communities.

This paper investigates the role of carrier interoperability as an enabler of MMS in mobile multimedia distance learning. Using instructor reuse of content and learner access to content as feasibility criteria, we empirically evaluate the performance, user adoption, and commercial market of MMS-based mobile education. This study deployed a value-added service that broadcasts videos via MMS to cell phones, and conducted a 9-month public education campaign with weekly broadcasts on breast cancer. We selected a video format and markup language that is compatible with domestic carriers and cell phones, and supports existing educational material. To contrast behaviors between participants with and without access to the Internet, we offered participants the same content via MMS, email and the Web. 277 participants enrolled in the campaign; 120 opted to receive the videos via mobile messaging, and 157 had Internet access and opted to receive videos via email or the Web. Campaign analytics reveal that all participants without Internet access successfully received the MMS video broadcasts, and significantly, one-third of participants with Internet access opted to receive the videos via MMS as well. We conclude with a discussion of why participants with Internet access may have chosen MMS over Internet-based alternatives. We also estimate the size of the market for MMS-based mobile education, and distinguish it from the person-to-person messaging market.

The A/e Anesthesia exchange ""pushed"" content at predetermined time intervals to learners and content was based on timely topics that were clinically relevant to their daily practice. The A/e Blog allowed multiple authors across disciplines to contribute content, thus providing learners potentially access to resources of knowledge from the entire team of clinician-educators at an institution. During the pilot phase of A/e blog implementation, the authors gained valuable insights into the use and limitations of web-based technology as a teaching tool. These included challenges with faculty and student participation, managing techno stress of faculty not fluent with the technology, tailoring content based on analytics data and web platform robustness and spam protection. Conclusion: With these insights in hand, we anticipate the launch of an even more robust A/e: Anesthesia Exchange (version 2.0) by the end of 2013. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Previously, this group was called ""early adopters"", however, I believe that the time in which educators become involved is not as important as their eagerness. This philosophy follows Thoreau's notion that, ""If a man loses pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer."" It is those, who hear different drummers that may appear to be tangent to institutional missions, although they may actually be leading initiatives, which the institution may eventually adopt. Some of the eager ideas which will be shared in this paper include Social Emotional Competency, Digital Content Creation Ecosystems, MOOCs, play with purpose maker economy fabrication labs, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, big data learning analytics, wearable technology, the quantifiable self, the internet of things, and mobile learning.

Every networked action by a user has the potential to be reinterpreted by other users. The original intentions of media makers emerge from this process in recontextualized form that I call the «digital afterlife». The phenomenon of digital afterlife has striking implications for youth-made media, which I explore in this article through an ethnographic analysis of behind-thescenes activities among a group of young people working with Youth Radio, a California youth organization, where they create high-impact media. The case study examined here centers on a major investigative reporting initiative within Youth Radio - a transmedia series on child sex trafficking produced by a 21-year-old reporter in collaboration with veteran editors. The analysis reveals the ways in which youth media ceases to be «youth media», once it moves into its digital afterlife, given the extent to which the content gets re-produced, again and again, by adult institutions with their own histories, agendas, and political economies. The article concludes by identifying key dimensions of literacy that young people invent and deploy through their experiments with social and mobile media, including: discovery, analytics, network mobilization, and platform programming.","Action; Digital afterlife; Media; Media literacy; Media production; Networked learning; Research; Social media; Youth; Youth radio","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865383991"

This article presents a theoretical discussion on the emergence of discovery with models, its potential to enhance research on learning and learners, and key lessons learned in how discovery with models can be conducted validly and effectively. We illustrate these issues through discussion of a case study where discovery with models was used to investigate a form of disengaged behavior (i.e., carelessness) in the context of middle school computer-based science inquiry. This behavior was acknowledged as a problem in education as early as the 1920s. With the increasing use of high-stakes testing, the cost of student carelessness can be higher. For instance, within computer-based learning environments, careless errors can result in reduced educational effectiveness, with students continuing to receive material they have already mastered. Despite the importance of this problem, it has received minimal research attention, in part because of difficulties in operationalizing carelessness as a construct. Building from theory on carelessness and a Bayesian framework for knowledge modeling, we use machine-learned detectors to predict carelessness within authentic use of a computer-based learning environment. We then use a discovery with models approach to link these validated carelessness measures to survey data to study the correlations between the prevalence of carelessness and student goal orientation. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","carelessness; discovery with models; educational data mining; goal orientation; learning analytics; science inquiry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883747195"

However, the instructional sensitivity of CAD logs, which describes how students respond to interventions withCADactions, has rarely been examined. For the logs to be used as reliable data sources for assessments, they must be instructionally sensitive. This paper reports the results of our systematic research on this important topic. To guide the research, we first propose a theoretical framework for computer-based assessments based on signal processing. This framework views assessments as detecting signals from the noisy background often present in large temporal learner datasets due to many uncontrollable factors and events in learning processes. To measure instructional sensitivity, we analyzed nearly 900 megabytes of process data logged by our Energy3D CAD software as collections of time series. These time-varying data were gathered from 65 high school students who solved a solar urban design challenge using Energy3D in seven class periods, with an intervention occurring in the middle of their design projects. Our analyses of these data show that the occurrence of the design actions unrelated to the intervention were not affected by it, whereas the occurrence of the design actions that the intervention targeted reveals a continuum of reactions ranging from no response to strong response. From the temporal patterns of these student responses, persistent effects and temporary effects (with different decay rates) were identified. Students' electronic notes taken during the design processes were used to validate their learning trajectories. These results show that an intervention occurring outside a CAD tool can leave a detectable trace in the CADlogs, suggesting that the logs can be used to quantitatively determine how effective an intervention has been for each individual student during an engineering design project. © 2014 TEMPUS Publications.","Computer-aided design; Computer-based assessment; Data-intensive research; Educational data mining; Engineering design; Instructional sensitivity; Learning analytics; Time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906317431"

Many social media monitoring tools are developed for monitoring business brands or public events. These tools may also be used to collect social media data for educational research and policy recommendation purposes. This study uses social media monitoring tool Radian6 to collect data from Twitter about engineering students' college experiences. The data are analyzed both in Radian6 and manually using qualitative content analysis.

More than 250 short modular videos are currently available that cover the syllabus of a comprehensive undergraduate course in Numerical Methods for Engineers. The motivation for the development of the audiovisual lectures was based on a pilot study that showed that the examination performance and student satisfaction increased with the availability of audiovisual lectures. A final assessment of these resources made via a video analytics tool shows increasing popularity of the videos, gives insight into the audience attention, and presents demographics by gender, age, and geography.addition, a summative rating survey of the courseware shows significant increase in the value of the quality of content and enhancement in student learning.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957442384"

In this paper, we define learning analytics, how it has been used in educationalinstitutions, what learning analytics tools are available, and how faculty can make use of data intheir courses to monitor and predict student performance. Finally, we discuss several issues andconcerns with the use of learning analytics in higher education.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880710773"

Measuring the literacy of a population, in the light of its linkage to individual and community wealth and wellbeing, is essential to determining the impact of compulsory education. The opportunity now is to develop tools to assess individual and societal attainment of these new literacies. Drawing on the work of Jenkins and colleagues (2006) and notions of a participatory culture, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for how learning analytics can assist in measuring individual achievement of multiliteracies and how this evaluative process can be scaled to provide an institutional perspective of the educational progress in fostering these fundamental skills.","Learning analytics; Multiliteracies","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907045509"

The implicit inclusion of modeling often results in conceptions held by students of models based on the everyday use of the term that neglects important predictive types of models. Purpose: We studied the effectiveness of an explicit modeling module designed to broaden student understandings of various approaches to and applications of modeling. Design/Method: A two-phase analysis of student conceptions was undertaken. Phase I analyzed the conceptions of an experimental group before and after they were taught an explicit modeling module. Phase II added a comparison group at a second institution. Results: A significant shift was observed for engineering students who were explicitly taught a modeling module. Student-held conceptions were predominantly descriptive-centric (e.g., physical models) throughout the investigation with an added focus on predictive (e.g., mathematical) modeling after completing the modeling module. These results were consistent for a comparison group. Conclusions: Explicit learning experiences about models and the modeling process need to be embedded into the engineering curriculum, specifically in the teaching of engineering design. Teaching modeling will improve student use and understanding of modeling as an important and pervasive engineering tool. © 2014 ASEE.","Adaptive expertise; Engineering design; Modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893945385"

To bridge this gap, the present study investigates whether human eye movement dynamics can predict computer-based assessment performance (accuracy of response) in different presentation modalities (picture vs. text). Eye-tracking system was employed to collect 63 college students' eye movement behaviors while they are engaging in the computer-based physics concept questions presented as either pictures or text. Students' responses were collected immediately after the picture or text presentations in order to determine the accuracy of responses. The results demonstrated that students' eye movement behavior can successfully predict their computer-based assessment performance. Remarkably, the mean fixation duration has the greatest power to predict the likelihood of responding the correct physics concepts successfully, followed by re-reading time in proportion. Additionally, the mean saccade distance has the least and negative power to predict the likelihood of responding the physics concepts correctly in the picture presentation. Interestingly, pictorial presentations appear to convey physics concepts more quickly and efficiently than do textual presentations. This study adds empirical evidence of a prediction model between eye movement behaviors and successful cognitive performance. Moreover, it provides insight into the modality effects on students' computer-based assessment performance through the use of eye movement behavior evidence. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs secondary research, scanning, and analysis. Findings: The three potential disruptions for education are: the availability of almost unlimited information on the internet; open source education leading to the decoupling of learning from credentialing; and the ability to understand the learning process in general and that of every learner through the application of learning analytics on the data being generated by students learning online. Research limitations/implications: These findings are conjectures. They are scenarios of some relatively current and longer-term futures; they are not formal predictions. But they might stimulate further reflection and research while the community monitors whether these scenarios will occur or not. Practical implications: Educational institutions should monitor the developments of internet-based pedagogies, open source education, and learning analytics in order to be prepared if any of these developments transform education in unexpected ways. Social implications: Society's approach to education was formed in the industrial era. It was designed to help students learn basic information and skills to be successful in relatively routine careers, such as manufacturing and service in the twentieth century. Machines are taking over that function today so that today's workers need to take more responsibility for their performance, be able to create new approaches to solve problems and work with others in a collaborative yet uncertain environment. These disruptions, should they occur, would provide the opportunity to build an education system that is appropriate for the twenty-first century. Originality/value: Very little of this material is truly new since the data are taken from secondary sources and most readers will know something about these developments. The originality here is using the framework of the three horizons of development to order and prepare for radical change. These developments are also potential game-changers that would create a new educational system, something that has not occurred in the developed world for over 100 years. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Disruption; Education; Era; Learning analytics; Online learning; Open learning; Open source; Pedagogy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860569987"
